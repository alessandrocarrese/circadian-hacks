# Light & Health: The Science of Spectral Exposure

Research-based articles on how artificial lighting affects human health, metabolism, and circadian biology.

## Overview

Modern LED lighting differs dramatically from natural sunlight in ways that standard metrics like color temperature (CCT) fail to capture. This research explores the spectral differences and their biological implications, based on original measurements of 91+ light sources.
