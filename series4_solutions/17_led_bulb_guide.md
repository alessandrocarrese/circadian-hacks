# A Practical Guide to LED Bulbs
## What the Labels Don't Tell You

*Part 17 of the Light Science Series*

---


Walk into any hardware store and you'll see LED bulbs labeled by color temperature: 2700K "Warm White," 4000K "Cool White," 6500K "Daylight."

These numbers tell you almost nothing about what actually matters for your health.

Here's what to look for-and what to avoid.


## The Color Temperature Myth

### Why CCT Fails

Two bulbs can have identical color temperatures but completely different spectral effects:

| Bulb | CCT | Blue:Red Ratio | Effect |
|------|-----|----------------|--------|
| Quality daylight LED | 6262K | 2.26:1 | Normal satiety |
| Cheap cold LED | 6503K | 5.69:1 | Hunger despite eating |

**Same color temperature. 2.5× different metabolic impact.**

The problem: CCT measures perceived color, not spectral content. A bulb can look "warm" while still having poor spectral ratios.


## The Metrics That Actually Matter

### 1. Blue:Red Ratio

This predicts metabolic effects far better than CCT:

| Ratio | Metabolic Effect | Typical Source |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| <1.5:1 | Optimal | Natural sunlight, incandescent |
| 1.5-2.5:1 | Acceptable | Quality warm/neutral LEDs |
| 2.5-4.0:1 | Concerning | Average LEDs |
| >4.0:1 | Problematic | Cheap cold LEDs |

**What to look for:** Bulbs with blue:red ratios under 2.5:1

### 2. S-Cone Content (420-460nm)

Determines circadian activation strength:

| S-Cone % | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| 15-20% | Morning light (Phase 1) |
| 5-10% | Daytime sustained use |
| <5% | Evening wind-down |
| <1% | Sleep-safe |

### 3. NIR Presence (700-780nm)

Near-infrared supports mitochondrial function:

| NIR % | Source |
|-------|--------|
| 20-30% | Morning sunlight |
| 50-55% | Incandescent |
| <1% | Standard LEDs |

**The LED problem:** Virtually all LEDs emit almost no NIR.


## Bulb Categories and Their Issues

### Cold/Daylight LEDs (5000-6500K)

**Typical specs:**
- S-cone: 18-25%
- Blue:Red ratio: 4.0-6.0:1
- NIR: <0.2%
- M/P ratio: 0.9-1.0

**Problems:**
- Excessive S-cone for sustained use (>30 min)
- Very poor blue:red ratio (hunger effects)
- No NIR (incomplete CCO photocycle)
- High melanopsin activation (evening disruption risk)

**Use case:** Morning Phase 1 only (≤30 min), then switch

### Warm White LEDs (2700-3000K)

**Typical specs:**
- S-cone: 4-7%
- Blue:Red ratio: 0.7-1.2:1
- NIR: <0.7%
- M/P ratio: 0.5-0.7

**Advantages:**
- Good blue:red ratio
- Lower S-cone (sustainable)
- Reduced melanopsin activation

**Problems:**
- Still no NIR
- May not provide enough morning activation
- Some have hidden blue peaks (check spectrum)

**Use case:** Daytime sustained use, evening transition

### "Extra Warm" LEDs (2000-2200K)

**Typical specs:**
- S-cone: 1-3%
- Blue:Red ratio: 0.3-0.5:1
- NIR: <0.4%
- M/P ratio: 0.3-0.4

**Advantages:**
- Very low circadian disruption
- Minimal melanopsin activation
- Good for evening

**Problems:**
- Still no NIR
- Color rendering poor for tasks
- May feel "too orange" for some uses

**Use case:** Evening wind-down (after sunset)


## The NIR Problem: Why All LEDs Fall Short

### What Incandescent Provided

Traditional incandescent bulbs:
- 54% NIR (700-780nm)
- Complete CCO photocycle support
- Natural activation/completion balance

### What LEDs Provide

Even the best LEDs:
- <1% NIR
- Activation signal (660nm) without completion signal (810nm)
- **967× more imbalanced** than incandescent

### The Hybrid Solution

Some people find improvement by mixing:
- LED for primary illumination
- Incandescent or NIR lamp for supplementation

**Example ratio:** 12W LED + 40W incandescent achieves balanced CCO activation similar to natural sunlight.


## Reading LED Specifications

### What to Ask For (If Available)

Most bulb packages don't include this data, but quality manufacturers may provide:

1. **Spectral Power Distribution (SPD)** - The actual spectrum graph
2. **Color Rendering Index (CRI)** - 90+ indicates fuller spectrum
3. **R9 value** - Deep red rendering (higher is better)
4. **Flicker percentage** - <3% is acceptable

### Red Flags on Packaging

- "High efficiency" with no spectral data
- Very low price (usually means single phosphor, narrow spectrum)
- No CRI listed
- Claims of "full spectrum" without evidence

### What Package Labels Actually Tell You

| Label Info | Usefulness |
|------------|------------|
| CCT (Color Temperature) | Low - doesn't predict health effects |
| Lumens | Medium - tells you brightness only |
| CRI | Medium - 90+ is generally better |
| Wattage | Low - efficiency metric only |


## Specific Use Cases

### Morning Light (Phase 1, 0-30 min)

**Need:** High S-cone (15-20%), reasonable blue:red ratio

**Options:**
1. **Best:** Step outside (any weather)
2. **Good:** Quality daylight LED (5000-6500K, CRI 90+)
3. **Acceptable:** SAD lamp positioned correctly

**Duration limit:** 30 minutes, then switch

### Daytime Work (Sustained)

**Need:** Moderate S-cone (5-10%), good blue:red ratio

**Options:**
1. **Best:** Indirect natural daylight
2. **Good:** Warm white LED (2700-3000K)
3. **Consider:** LED + incandescent mix for NIR

**Duration:** Can sustain for work hours

### Evening Wind-Down (After Sunset)

**Need:** Very low S-cone (<5%), minimal melanopsin

**Options:**
1. **Best:** Extra warm LED (2000-2200K)
2. **Good:** Warm LED dimmed significantly
3. **Alternative:** Amber/red LED or candles

**Timing:** Start 2-3 hours before bed

### Sleep Environment

**Need:** Minimal light, no blue/cyan

**Options:**
1. **Best:** Complete darkness
2. **If needed:** Narrow-band red (660nm) at very low intensity
3. **Avoid:** Any white light, night lights with blue content

## Practical Recommendations

### Minimum Setup (Budget)
1. One cold LED bulb for morning only (≤30 min)
2. Warm LED bulbs for rest of day
3. Dim warm LEDs or use candles evening

### Better Setup
1. Quality daylight LED (CRI 95+) for morning
2. Warm LEDs (2700K) for daytime
3. Extra warm LEDs (2200K) for evening
4. One incandescent or NIR lamp for mixing

### Optimal Setup
1. Access to outdoor light morning
2. Indirect natural light daytime when possible
3. Warm LEDs + incandescent mix for cloudy days/evenings
4. Extra warm or amber for pre-sleep


## Key Takeaways

1. **CCT is nearly useless** for predicting health effects
2. **Blue:red ratio** is the key metric for metabolic safety
3. **All LEDs lack NIR**-consider supplementation
4. **Match bulb to time of day:** Cold morning, warm day, extra warm evening
5. **Duration limits apply:** High S-cone lights should not be used >30 min continuously

## Technical Appendix

### Measuring Your Bulbs

If you want to know your bulb's actual spectrum:
- Consumer spectrometers available (~$300-500)
- Some smartphone apps give rough estimates
- Request SPD data from manufacturer

### CRI and R-Values

CRI (Color Rendering Index) measures fidelity across 8 color samples. High CRI (90+) generally indicates:
- Fuller spectrum
- Better color accuracy
- Usually better spectral ratios

R9 specifically measures deep red (660nm region). Low R9 despite high CRI indicates missing red content.

### Flicker

LED flicker can cause:
- Headaches
- Eye strain
- Concentration issues

Look for <3% flicker or "flicker-free" designation. Higher quality drivers eliminate this issue.
