# A Full Day Lighting Protocol
## Putting It All Together

*Part 20 of the Light Science Series*

---


We've covered the science. We've explored the problems. We've discussed individual solutions.

Now let's put it all together into a practical, day-long protocol that works with your biology.


## The Framework: Four Phases

Your lighting day should have four distinct phases, each with different goals:

| Phase | Timing | Goal | Key Metric |
|-------|--------|------|------------|
| **1. Activation** | Wake → +90min | Circadian phase set, alertness | High S-cone (15-20%) |
| **2. Sustain** | +90min → Sunset-2h | Alertness without stress | Moderate S-cone (5-10%) |
| **3. Wind-Down** | Sunset-2h → Sleep-2h | Signal day ending | Low S-cone (<5%) |
| **4. Sleep Prep** | Sleep-2h → Sleep | Enable melatonin | MEDI <10 lux |


## Phase 1: Activation (0-90 minutes after wake)

### Sub-Phase 1A: S-Cone Window (First 30 minutes)

**Goal:** Maximum circadian phase-setting

**The science:** S-cones contribute 51% of signaling, melanopsin only 2%

**Light requirements:**
- S-cone content: 15-20%
- Blue:Red ratio: 1.5-2.5:1
- Intensity: 1000-2000 lux (artificial) or any outdoor level
- Position: Any (S-cones are distributed throughout retina)

**Best practices:**
- Step outside if possible (15-30 min)
- Face the sky, not just sunlight
- If using artificial light, use high-quality daylight LED
- Remove glasses if safe (reduces UV dissociation)

**Duration:** 15-30 minutes maximum, then transition

### Sub-Phase 1B: Melanopsin Transition (30-90 minutes)

**Goal:** Sustain alertness while reducing S-cone load

**The science:** Melanopsin rises from 2% to 51-79%

**Light requirements:**
- S-cone content: 5-10% (50% reduction)
- Blue:Red ratio: 1.0-2.0:1
- Intensity: 500-1000 lux
- Position: Overhead preferred (melanopsin cells in inferior retina)

**Best practices:**
- Switch to warm white LED or indirect daylight
- Reduce intensity from Phase 1A
- Ceiling-mounted or high-positioned lights
- Window seat with indirect light is excellent


## Phase 2: Sustain (90 minutes after wake → 2 hours before sunset)

**Goal:** Maintain alertness without stress

**The science:** Melanopsin dominates (79-92%), S-cones adapted

**Light requirements:**
- S-cone content: 5-10%
- Blue:Red ratio: 0.8-2.0:1 (metabolically safe)
- Intensity: 300-750 lux typical office/home
- Position: Overhead preferred

**Best practices:**
- Warm white LEDs (2700-3000K)
- Indirect natural light when available
- Periodic outdoor breaks (natural spectrum recalibration)
- Monitor brightness matched to ambient

**Duration limit:** None (this is sustainable spectrum)

### The Monitor Situation

If working on screens during Phase 2:
- Ambient lighting should exceed screen brightness
- Warm ambient light dilutes screen blue contribution
- Take periodic breaks (20-20-20 rule)
- Afternoon: consider enabling early night mode

### NIR Supplementation (Optional)

If using LEDs exclusively:
- All LEDs lack NIR (<1%)
- Consider adding incandescent source (40W provides good NIR)
- Or dedicated NIR lamp for background
- Ratio: ~1:3 LED:incandescent by wattage


## Phase 3: Wind-Down (2 hours before sunset → 2 hours before sleep)

**Goal:** Signal that day is ending

**The science:** Natural light would be declining toward 10 MEDI

**Light requirements:**
- S-cone content: <5%
- MEDI target: 30-50 lux
- Color: Warm (2700K or warmer)
- Position: Lower (table lamps preferred over ceiling)

**Best practices:**
- Dim overhead lights to 25-50%
- Switch cold bulbs off, warm bulbs on
- Close blinds/curtains at sunset
- Lower light sources (reduces melanopsin activation via inferior retina)

**Screen management:**
- Enable night mode / blue filter
- Reduce screen brightness significantly
- Increase viewing distance
- Consider blue-blocking glasses (light amber)


## Phase 4: Sleep Prep (2 hours before sleep → sleep)

**Goal:** Enable melatonin onset

**The science:** MEDI must drop below 10 lux for melatonin

**Light requirements:**
- S-cone content: <2%
- MEDI target: <10 lux
- Color: Extra warm (2000-2200K) or amber/red
- Position: Minimal, low, indirect

**Best practices:**
- Extra warm LEDs only
- Single dim lamp or candles
- No overhead lighting
- Bedroom completely dark

**Screen management:**
- Screens off if possible
- If necessary: maximum filtering + minimum brightness + maximum distance
- Quality blue-blocking glasses (orange/amber) mandatory
- Consider moving to TV at distance rather than close screens

**Bathroom strategy:**
- Install dimmer or separate night-mode lighting
- Amber/red nightlight for nighttime visits
- Avoid bright overhead until morning


## The Complete Timeline

### Example: 7am wake, 11pm sleep

```
7:00am ─ WAKE
│
├─ PHASE 1A: S-Cone Activation
│  ├─ Step outside or use daylight LED
│  ├─ 15-30 min, 1000+ lux
│  └─ S-cone: 15-20%
│
7:30am ─ Transition
│
├─ PHASE 1B: Melanopsin Transition  
│  ├─ Switch to warm white or indirect daylight
│  ├─ 60 min, 500-1000 lux
│  └─ S-cone: 5-10%
│
8:30am ─ PHASE 2: Sustain Begins
│
├─ Normal work lighting
├─ Warm white LEDs or indirect daylight
├─ Periodic outdoor breaks

```


## Seasonal Adjustments

### Summer (Long Days)

- Sunset may be 8-9pm: Wind-Down starts later
- More natural light available: Use it
- Evening social activities possible before Wind-Down
- Adjust Phase 3/4 timing to actual sunset

### Winter (Short Days)

- Sunset may be 4-5pm: Wind-Down starts earlier
- Morning darkness: Consider red light pre-dawn
- SAD risk: Prioritize morning Phase 1
- May need to extend Phase 2 artificially

### Latitude Considerations

- High latitudes: Extreme seasonal variation
- Near equator: Consistent year-round
- Adjust protocol to actual daylight availability


## Travel / Time Zone Adaptation

### Eastward Travel (Phase Advance Needed)

- Pre-trip: Morning light earlier each day
- On arrival: Bright morning light at new local time
- Avoid evening light at new location
- Expect 1-2 days adjustment per hour shifted

### Westward Travel (Phase Delay Needed)

- Pre-trip: Evening light later each day
- On arrival: Avoid morning light initially
- Evening light at new local time
- Generally easier than eastward


## Troubleshooting

### "I can't fall asleep"

Check:
- MEDI in final 2 hours (should be <10)
- Screen use in Phase 4
- Bedroom light leakage
- Wind-Down start time (may need earlier)

### "I can't wake up"

Check:
- Phase 1 light quality and timing
- Consistency of wake time
- Evening light (too much delays phase)
- Consider red light pre-dawn strategy

### "I'm tired all day"

Check:
- Phase 1 completion (full 90 min?)
- Phase 2 lighting (too dim?)
- Blue:Red ratio of daytime lights
- NIR availability (LED-only environment?)

### "I get hungry at weird times"

Check:
- Blue:Red ratio of sustained lighting
- Cold LED exposure duration
- Switch to warmer spectrum or add incandescent


## The Minimum Viable Protocol

If you can only do three things:

1. **Morning light exposure** (15-30 min outdoor or bright indoor)
2. **Dim and warm after sunset** (transition to 2700K, reduce brightness)
3. **Darkness before sleep** (final 30-60 min in near-darkness)

This captures ~70% of the benefit with minimal effort.


## Key Takeaways

1. **Four phases:** Activation → Sustain → Wind-Down → Sleep Prep
2. **Timing matters:** Phase transitions are as important as phase content
3. **Spectrum changes:** High S-cone morning, low S-cone evening
4. **Intensity decreases:** Match natural light decline pattern
5. **Consistency is critical:** Same timing (±30 min) daily
