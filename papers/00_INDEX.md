## Paper Inventory

### Paper 1: Natural Light Spectral Protection & Temporal Dynamics
**File:** [01_natural_light_spectral_protection.md](01_natural_light_spectral_protection.md)

**Title:** "Spectral Dynamics of Natural Light and the Spectral Protection Ratio: Evidence for Intensity-Dependent Protection Mechanisms and Temporal Signaling Absent in LED Sources"

**Key Findings:**
- Natural light exhibits inverse relationship between intensity and S-cone activation (18% at 12 lux → 8.8% at 95,326 lux)
- S-cone % declines 56% from dawn to midday (slope: -0.82%/hour), paralleling S-cone→melanopsin handoff in circadian signaling
- SPR metric proposed: Natural light SPR 1.54-10.54 (mean 3.82); Cold LEDs SPR 0.53-0.81 (inverted)
- Natural NIR content: 22.1%; LED NIR content: 0.8-7.2% (67-96% deficit)
- Temporal trajectory may serve as time-of-day signal; static LEDs provide "perpetual dawn" signal
- HPA axis implications: Cold LED may maintain elevated cortisol beyond natural 5-9am window

**Target Journals:** *Chronobiology International*, *Light: Science & Applications*, *PLOS ONE*

**Status:** Draft complete (merged from Papers 1 + 3 + 5)

### Paper 2: UV-Circadian Dissociation & Myopia
**File:** [02_uv_circadian_dissociation.md](02_uv_circadian_dissociation.md)

**Title:** "UV-Circadian Signal Dissociation Induced by Corrective Eyewear: Implications for Neuropsin (OPN5) Signaling and Myopia Prevention"

**Key Finding:** Eyeglasses block 79% UV while enhancing melanopsin 22%, creating 5.8× dissociation. OPN5 signaling at 380nm for myopia prevention may be compromised in eyeglass wearers.

**Target Journals:** *Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science*, *Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics*

**Status:** Draft complete

### Paper 3: Violet-Pump LED Analysis
**File:** [04_violet_pump_led_analysis.md](04_violet_pump_led_analysis.md)

**Title:** "Violet-Pump LED Technology: Trading Metabolic Photodamage for Mutagenic Risk? A Critical Analysis of Spectral Photobiology"

**Key Finding:** Violet-pump LEDs (405nm) may reduce metabolic damage ~25% while increasing DNA damage potential ~190%. UV-A:NIR ratio inverted 43× vs sunlight.

**Target Journals:** *Photochemistry and Photobiology*, *Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B*

**Status:** Draft complete

### Paper 4: Window Glass NIR Deficit
**File:** [06_window_glass_nir_deficit.md](06_window_glass_nir_deficit.md)

**Title:** "Near-Infrared Transmission Characteristics of Architectural Glazing: Comparing Historical and Modern Window Technologies"

**Key Finding:** Modern Low-E windows create 8.4% NIR deficit (61% NIR block vs 53% visible block). Vintage glass preserves spectral balance better.

**Target Journals:** *Building and Environment*, *Energy and Buildings*

**Status:** Draft complete

### Paper 5: S-cone/Melanopsin Ratio, Hunger & Dopamine (NEW)
**File:** [07_scone_melanopsin_hunger_dopamine.md](07_scone_melanopsin_hunger_dopamine.md)

**Title:** "S-cone to Melanopsin Ratio as a Determinant of Appetite and Dopaminergic Tone: Why Modern Display Technology May Drive Chronic Hunger and Compulsive Behavior"

**Key Findings:**
- Natural light S/M ratio range: 0.69-1.13 (never exceeds 1.13)
- Computer monitors: S/M ratio 1.33-2.90 (up to 157% above natural maximum)
- 445nm peak (monitors) maximally stimulates S-cones → retinal dopamine
- High S/M = dopaminergic "wanting" without melanopsin-mediated satiety
- Mechanism for screen-associated obesity, compulsive eating, addiction patterns
- Proposes "wanting without liking" state from chronic high S/M exposure

**Target Journals:** *Cell Metabolism*, *Nature Neuroscience*, *Obesity*, *Appetite*

**Status:** Draft complete
