# S-cone to Melanopsin Ratio as a Determinant of Appetite and Dopaminergic Tone: Why Modern Display Technology May Drive Chronic Hunger and Compulsive Behavior

## Abstract

**Background:** Modern LED displays emit light with spectral peaks near 445nm, optimized for energy efficiency and color gamut rather than biological compatibility. The ratio of S-cone stimulation (420-460nm) to melanopsin stimulation (460-500nm) determines the balance between retinal dopamine release and hypothalamic satiety signaling. Natural light maintains S-cone/melanopsin (S/M) ratios between 0.69-1.13 across all conditions; modern displays routinely exceed 2.0, with some monitors reaching 2.9.

**Objectives:** (1) To characterize S/M ratios across natural light conditions and artificial sources; (2) To propose a neurobiological mechanism linking high S/M ratios to hunger, dopamine dysregulation, and compulsive behavior; (3) To quantify the departure of modern displays from evolutionary baselines.

**Methods:** Spectral power distributions (380-780nm) were measured for 33 natural light conditions and 24 artificial sources including LED bulbs and computer monitors. S-cone activation (420-460nm weighted) and melanopsin activation (460-500nm weighted) were calculated as percentages of total spectral power. S/M ratio was computed for each source.

**Results:** Natural light S/M ratios ranged from 0.69 (direct sun) to 1.13 (overcast sky), with mean 0.92. Natural light never exceeded S/M = 1.13 under any measured condition. Among artificial sources: warm LEDs (2700K) showed S/M 0.56-0.83; cold LEDs (6500K) showed S/M 1.20-1.88; computer monitors showed S/M 1.33-2.90. The highest-measured monitor (S/M = 2.90) exceeded the natural maximum by 157%.

**Conclusions:** Modern display technology produces S/M ratios far outside the evolutionary range. Given the established connections between S-cone activation and retinal dopamine release, and between melanopsin and hypothalamic satiety circuits, chronic exposure to high S/M light may produce a state of sustained dopaminergic "wanting" without corresponding "satisfaction" signaling. This mechanism may contribute to the observed associations between screen time and obesity, compulsive eating, attention disorders, and addictive behavior patterns. Display manufacturers should consider spectral optimization targeting S/M ratios below 1.0.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Spectral Environment and Human Physiology

Human physiology evolved under natural light characterized by predictable spectral composition varying with solar angle, atmospheric conditions, and time of day (Roenneberg & Foster, 1997). The visual and non-visual photoreceptive systems are tuned to this spectral environment, with distinct photoreceptor classes serving different physiological functions:

- **S-cones** (short-wavelength sensitive): Peak sensitivity ~440nm, primarily visual color discrimination, but also input to retinal dopaminergic circuits
- **Melanopsin-containing ipRGCs**: Peak sensitivity ~480nm, non-visual functions including circadian entrainment, pupillary response, and hypothalamic signaling
- **M-cones and L-cones**: Longer wavelength sensitivity, primarily visual function

The spectral composition of light-specifically the ratio of shorter to longer wavelengths within the blue-cyan range-determines the relative activation of these systems and consequently influences both visual processing and systemic physiology.

### 1.2 The Dopamine Connection

Retinal dopamine is synthesized and released by dopaminergic amacrine cells in the inner retina. These cells receive input from photoreceptors and modulate retinal function in response to light (Witkovsky, 2004). Critically, S-cone pathways provide significant input to dopaminergic amacrine cells, and short-wavelength light is a potent stimulus for retinal dopamine release (Nizar et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2012).

Retinal dopamine does not remain local. The retina has bidirectional communication with the hypothalamus via:
1. Direct ipRGC projections to hypothalamic nuclei (Hattar et al., 2006)
2. Dopaminergic modulation of ipRGC sensitivity and signaling (Van Hook et al., 2012)
3. Potential retrograde signaling affecting central dopaminergic tone

### 1.3 The Hypothalamic Appetite Network

The lateral hypothalamus (LH) contains orexin/hypocretin neurons that integrate:
- Light information (via ipRGC projections)
- Metabolic state
- Arousal level
- Reward/motivation signaling

Orexin neurons project to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the origin of mesolimbic dopamine pathways mediating reward and motivation (Harris & Aston-Jones, 2006). Activation of orexin neurons:
- Increases food-seeking behavior
- Enhances motivation and arousal
- Stimulates VTA dopamine release
- Promotes wakefulness

Importantly, melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs project directly to hypothalamic regions including areas adjacent to orexin neuron populations (Fernandez et al., 2018). This provides a pathway by which spectral composition of light can influence appetite and reward circuits.

### 1.4 The "Wanting" vs "Liking" Distinction

Berridge and Robinson's incentive salience theory distinguishes between:
- **Wanting** (dopamine-mediated): Motivation, craving, seeking behavior
- **Liking** (opioid-mediated): Pleasure, satisfaction, consummatory reward

Dopamine primarily drives "wanting"-the urge to seek and acquire-while the satisfaction of having acquired is mediated by separate opioid circuits (Berridge & Robinson, 1998). A system that stimulates "wanting" without enabling "liking" produces a state of perpetual unsatisfied craving.

### 1.5 Hypothesis

We hypothesize that the ratio of S-cone to melanopsin activation (S/M ratio) determines the balance between dopaminergic "wanting" signals and hypothalamic satiety/satisfaction signals. Natural light maintains S/M ratios within a narrow range (approximately 0.7-1.1) that produces balanced signaling. Modern artificial light sources, particularly LED displays with spectral peaks near 445nm, produce S/M ratios far exceeding natural ranges, potentially inducing chronic dopaminergic activation without corresponding satiety signaling-a neurobiological substrate for chronic hunger, craving, and compulsive behavior.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Spectral Measurements

Spectral power distributions were measured at a location in Southern Italy (41.0°N, 14.6°E) during December 2025 using a calibrated spectroradiometer (380-780nm, 1nm resolution). Measurements included:

**Natural light (n=33):**
- Dawn/sunrise conditions (n=6)
- Morning conditions (n=8)
- Noon conditions (n=4)
- Afternoon conditions (n=5)
- Sunset/dusk conditions (n=4)
- Indoor with natural light through windows (n=6)

**Artificial sources (n=24):**
- Warm LEDs, 2700K (n=8)
- Neutral LEDs, 4000-5000K (n=6)
- Cold LEDs, 6000-6500K (n=5)
- Computer monitors (n=3)
- Reference incandescent (n=1)
- Mixed/specialty sources (n=1)

### 2.2 Spectral Band Calculations

Two complementary methods were used to calculate S/M ratios:

**Method 1: Band Integration (Primary)**

S-cone activation percentage: Integrated spectral power from 420-460nm as percentage of total power (380-780nm):

$$S_{cone}\% = \frac{\int_{420}^{460} S(\lambda) \, d\lambda}{\int_{380}^{780} S(\lambda) \, d\lambda} \times 100$$

Melanopsin activation percentage: Integrated spectral power from 460-500nm as percentage of total power:

$$Melanopsin\% = \frac{\int_{460}^{500} S(\lambda) \, d\lambda}{\int_{380}^{780} S(\lambda) \, d\lambda} \times 100$$

$$S/M_{band} = \frac{S_{cone}\%}{Melanopsin\%}$$

**Method 2: Action Spectrum Weighting (Validation)**

Weighted S/M ratios were calculated using CIE photoreceptor action spectra:

$$S/M_{weighted} = \frac{\int S(\lambda) \cdot A_{S-cone}(\lambda) \, d\lambda}{\int S(\lambda) \cdot A_{melanopsin}(\lambda) \, d\lambda}$$

Where $A_{S-cone}(\lambda)$ approximates the CIE 2006 S-cone fundamental (peak 440nm, Gaussian approximation with sigma=19nm), and $A_{melanopsin}(\lambda)$ approximates the CIE S 026:2018 melanopic action spectrum (peak 480nm, sigma=32nm).

**Methodological Note:** Action spectrum weighting yields systematically lower absolute S/M values (natural light: 0.43-0.69 weighted vs 0.69-1.13 band integration) but preserves the relative ordering and proportional differences between source categories. The band integration method is retained as the primary metric for interpretability and consistency with established spectral band analysis conventions. Key findings regarding natural vs artificial light differences hold under both methods.

### 2.3 Blue Peak Identification

The wavelength of maximum spectral power within the 420-500nm range was identified for each source to characterize the spectral peak location.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Natural Light S/M Ratios

Table 1 presents S/M ratios across natural light conditions.

**Table 1. S-cone/Melanopsin ratios in natural light**

| Condition | n | S/M Range | S/M Mean ± SD | Blue Peak (nm) |
|-----------|---|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Dawn/Sunrise | 6 | 0.70-1.06 | 0.93 ± 0.14 | 450-465 |
| Morning | 8 | 0.77-1.13 | 0.91 ± 0.13 | 450-492 |
| Noon | 4 | 0.80-1.12 | 0.98 ± 0.15 | 403-491 |
| Afternoon | 5 | 0.79-0.89 | 0.84 ± 0.04 | 473-500 |
| Sunset/Dusk | 4 | 0.99-1.05 | 1.02 ± 0.03 | 451 |
| Indoor/Window | 6 | 0.69-0.99 | 0.83 ± 0.11 | 495-500 |
| **All Natural** | **33** | **0.69-1.13** | **0.92 ± 0.12** | - |

Critical finding: **No natural light condition exceeded S/M = 1.13**

### 3.2 Natural Light by Exposure Type

**Table 2. S/M ratios by natural light category**

| Category | S/M Range | S/M Mean | Interpretation |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Direct sun | 0.70-1.03 | 0.88 | Balanced, satiety-favoring |
| Shade/shadow | 1.00-1.12 | 1.04 | Slight S-cone emphasis |
| Sky only | 0.85-1.13 | 0.98 | Near-balanced |
| Tree shade | 1.02-1.05 | 1.03 | Slight S-cone emphasis |
| Building shade | 1.12 | 1.12 | Highest natural S/M |

Building shade (pure Rayleigh-scattered skylight, no direct sun) showed the highest natural S/M ratio at 1.12, representing the upper bound of natural exposure.

### 3.3 Artificial Light S/M Ratios

**Table 3. S-cone/Melanopsin ratios in artificial light sources**

| Source Category | n | S/M Range | S/M Mean ± SD | Blue Peak (nm) |
|-----------------|---|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Incandescent | 1 | 0.46 | - | 470 |
| Warm LED (2700K) | 8 | 0.56-0.83 | 0.72 ± 0.11 | 451-457 |
| Neutral LED (4000-5000K) | 6 | 0.79-1.00 | 0.88 ± 0.09 | 450-470 |
| Cold LED (6000-6500K) | 5 | 1.20-1.88 | 1.45 ± 0.30 | 448-452 |
| Computer monitors | 2 | 1.33-2.90 | 2.12 ± 1.11 | 446-448 |

### 3.4 Monitor Analysis

**Table 4. Computer monitor spectral characteristics**

| Monitor | Blue Peak | S-cone % | Melanopsin % | S/M Ratio | vs Natural Max |
|---------|-----------|----------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| Monitor (low blue) | 446nm | 19.10 | 14.39 | 1.33 | +18% |
| Monitor (cool/normal) | 446nm | 21.18 | 7.30 | 2.90 | **+157%** |

The standard "cool" monitor mode produced S/M ratio of 2.90, exceeding the natural maximum (1.13) by 157%.

### 3.5 Spectral Peak Analysis

**Table 5. Blue peak wavelength by source type**

| Source Type | Blue Peak Range | S/M Correlation |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Natural light | 403-500nm | Variable |
| Warm LED | 451-457nm | S/M 0.56-0.83 |
| Cold LED | 448-452nm | S/M 1.20-1.88 |
| Computer monitor | 445-448nm | S/M 1.33-2.90 |

Key finding: Monitors with peaks at 445-448nm showed the highest S/M ratios due to:
1. Peak positioned at S-cone maximum sensitivity (~440nm)
2. Sharp spectral falloff reducing melanopsin activation
3. Minimal emission in cyan (470-500nm) range

### 3.6 S-cone Sensitivity at Key Wavelengths

S-cone sensitivity was modeled as Gaussian function peaking at 440nm (σ ≈ 20nm):

**Table 6. Relative S-cone sensitivity by wavelength**

| Wavelength | Relative S-cone Sensitivity |
|------------|----------------------------|
| 440nm | 1.000 (maximum) |
| 445nm | 0.969 |
| 448nm | 0.923 |
| 451nm | 0.860 |
| 454nm | 0.783 |
| 460nm | 0.607 |
| 480nm | 0.135 |

A display peak at 445nm produces 7.2× more S-cone activation than melanopsin activation at 480nm, compared to 1.4× at 460nm-a 5-fold difference in S/M drive.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 The Natural S/M Range

Across 33 natural light measurements spanning dawn to dusk, direct sun to deep shade, the S/M ratio remained within a remarkably narrow range: **0.69-1.13**. This range presumably represents the spectral environment under which human photoreceptive and hypothalamic systems evolved over millions of years.

The highest natural S/M (1.12-1.13) occurred in:
- Building shade (pure skylight)
- Morning sky only (Rayleigh-dominated)
- Twilight conditions

These represent natural contexts where slightly elevated alertness and food-seeking would be adaptive (morning activation, evening last-meal preparation). Even these conditions remained at or below S/M = 1.13.

### 4.2 Artificial Light Exceeds Natural Bounds

Cold LEDs and computer monitors routinely exceed natural S/M maxima:

| Source | S/M Ratio | Exceeds Natural Max By |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| Cold LED (typical) | 1.45 | +28% |
| Cold LED (high) | 1.88 | +66% |
| Monitor (cool) | 2.90 | +157% |

A standard computer monitor in normal mode produces S/M signals **2.5× higher** than any natural condition ever measured.

### 4.3 The Neurobiological Mechanism

We propose the following pathway linking high S/M ratios to hunger and compulsive behavior:

**Step 1: S-cone Activation → Retinal Dopamine**
- 445nm light maximally stimulates S-cones
- S-cones synapse with dopaminergic amacrine cells
- High S-cone activation → elevated retinal dopamine release
- Retinal dopamine modulates ipRGC signaling to hypothalamus

**Step 2: Reduced Melanopsin Activation → Impaired Satiety Signaling**
- 445nm poorly stimulates melanopsin (peak 480nm)
- Melanopsin ipRGCs project to hypothalamic satiety centers
- Low melanopsin activation → reduced "satisfaction" signal
- SCN circadian signal also impaired

**Step 3: Hypothalamic Integration → Orexin Activation**
- High dopamine + low satiety = net orexin activation
- Orexin neurons interpret this as "twilight foraging" state
- Downstream activation of VTA dopamine (wanting)
- Increased food-seeking, motivation, arousal

**Step 4: Chronic Exposure → Dysregulation**
- 8+ hours/day of S/M > 2.0
- Continuous "wanting" signal without "satisfied" resolution
- Dopamine system downregulation (tolerance)
- Escalating stimulation required for baseline function
- Pattern resembles addiction neurobiology

### 4.4 "Wanting" Without "Liking"

The S/M imbalance may specifically dissociate wanting from liking:

| Signal | Pathway | Effect of High S/M |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Wanting | Dopamine (VTA) | ↑↑↑ Elevated |
| Liking | Opioid | → Unchanged |
| Satiety | Melanopsin→Hypothalamus | ↓↓ Suppressed |

This produces the characteristic phenomenology of:
- Eating without hunger satisfaction
- Scrolling without content satisfaction
- Seeking without finding
- Craving without fulfillment

### 4.5 Temporal Dynamics: The All-Day Problem

Natural light S/M varies across the day:

```
Dawn:      S/M ~1.0  → "Wake, seek breakfast"
Morning:   S/M ~0.85 → "Active, fed, productive"
Noon:      S/M ~0.80 → "Satiated, rest period"
Afternoon: S/M ~0.85 → "Active, moderate hunger"
Dusk:      S/M ~1.0  → "Final meal, wind down"
Night:     S/M → 0   → "Sleep, fast, restore"
```

Monitor use imposes static S/M ~2.9 for 8-12+ hours:

```
All day:   S/M 2.9   → "SEEK SEEK SEEK SEEK SEEK"
Night:     S/M 2.9   → "SEEK" (when expecting 0)
```

The circadian variation in S/M ratio may itself be a biological signal-the trajectory indicating time-of-day. Static high S/M eliminates this signal, producing:
1. Loss of temporal appetite regulation
2. Loss of circadian metabolic cues
3. Continuous foraging activation
4. No fasting/restoration period

### 4.6 Cumulative Dose

Over extended exposure periods, the cumulative excess becomes substantial:

**Table 7. Cumulative S/M exposure estimates**

| Exposure | Natural | Monitor (S/M 2.9) | Excess |
|----------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 hour | 0.92 | 2.90 | +215% |
| 8 hours | 7.4 | 23.2 | +214% |
| 1 year (8h/day) | 2,700 | 8,470 | +5,770 |
| 10 years | 27,000 | 84,700 | +57,700 |

Chronic exposure accumulates a massive excess of high-S/M stimulation with unknown but potentially significant long-term neurobiological effects.

### 4.7 Spatial Dissociation: Why Windows Cannot Rescue Monitor Exposure

A critical question arises: can ambient natural light from windows compensate for monitor S/M exposure? Total power analysis suggests yes-window light at 1000 lux contributes ~80% of total retinal irradiance when combined with a 185 lux monitor. However, this analysis ignores the spatial distribution of photoreceptors.

**Table 7b. Monitor + Window power analysis**

| Source | Lux | S-cone Power | Melanopsin Power | S/M Weighted |
|--------|-----|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| Monitor (cool) | 185 | 170.6 | 230.1 | 0.74 |
| Window (vertical) | 1056 | 456.2 | 988.4 | 0.46 |
| Combined (simple sum) | 1241 | 626.8 | 1218.5 | 0.51 |

The combined S/M of 0.51 appears favorable-below the natural range maximum. However, this calculation assumes uniform retinal illumination, which does not occur in practice.

**Retinal topography creates spatial segregation:**

1. **S-cones concentrate in the fovea and parafovea** (central 10-15 degrees). When viewing a monitor, this high-density S-cone region receives predominantly monitor light.

2. **Melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs concentrate in the inferior retina** (Dacey et al., 2005). They respond preferentially to light from the upper visual field-overhead and peripheral sources.

3. **Monitor position** (frontal, typically below eye level) projects to central and superior retina, where S-cones are dense but ipRGCs are sparse.

4. **Window light** (from side/above) projects to inferior and peripheral retina, where ipRGCs are concentrated.

**The result is a spatially-segregated dissociation:**

| Retinal Region | Primary Light Source | Receptor Density | Effective S/M |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Central fovea | Monitor (direct gaze) | S-cone: HIGH, ipRGC: LOW | ~0.74 |
| Parafovea | Monitor + some window | S-cone: HIGH, ipRGC: LOW | ~0.65 |
| Inferior peripheral | Window (upper field) | S-cone: LOW, ipRGC: HIGH | ~0.46 |

This means:
- The foveal region where visual attention is directed receives **monitor-dominated S/M ratios**
- Window light activates melanopsin ipRGCs effectively, providing circadian signal
- But window light **cannot rescue the S-cone overstimulation** occurring in foveal vision
- The dopaminergic pathway (S-cone driven) and satiety pathway (melanopsin driven) receive **discordant signals from different light sources**

**Implications for the "wanting without satisfaction" hypothesis:**

Even in well-lit offices with large windows:
- Melanopsin receives adequate natural-spectrum stimulation (satiety signal present)
- S-cones in foveal vision receive chronic monitor-spectrum overstimulation (excessive "wanting" signal)
- The two systems receive spectrally mismatched inputs from spatially segregated sources

This may be worse than the simple calculation suggests: rather than a blended intermediate signal, the brain receives **two contradictory signals simultaneously**-strong satiety input from peripheral/inferior retina AND strong seeking input from foveal retina. The net effect on hypothalamic integration is unpredictable but unlikely to be the simple average.

**The overhead light solution:**

Unlike side windows, **overhead lighting** projects onto the inferior retina-precisely where ipRGC density is highest. This suggests a potential compensatory strategy:

| Light Source Position | Retinal Projection | Primary Receptors Engaged |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Monitor (frontal) | Central/superior retina | S-cones (HIGH), ipRGCs (LOW) |
| Side window | Temporal/nasal peripheral | ipRGCs (MODERATE) |
| Overhead light | Inferior retina | ipRGCs (HIGH) |

Bright overhead lighting with appropriate spectrum (low S/M, adequate melanopic content) could potentially:
1. Maximize ipRGC stimulation in their highest-density region
2. Provide competing melanopsin input to the same hypothalamic circuits receiving S-cone-driven dopamine signals
3. Partially restore the balance between "wanting" and satiety pathways

This may explain why working in bright, overhead-lit environments feels different from working in dim rooms with only monitor illumination-even when total lux at eye level is similar. The spatial distribution of light matters as much as total intensity.

**Subjective experience confirms the geometry:**

Anecdotally, high-S/M light sources (cold LEDs, monitors) are reported to feel more "harsh" or "aggressive" when positioned frontally than when overhead. This aligns with the anatomical prediction:
- **Frontal light** projects directly to the fovea and parafovea where S-cone density is highest
- **Overhead light** projects to inferior retina where S-cones are sparse but ipRGCs are dense

The same cold LED at 6500K may feel tolerable as ceiling lighting but uncomfortable as a desk lamp at eye level-not because total illuminance differs, but because frontal positioning delivers the high-S/M spectrum directly to the S-cone-dense central retina. This subjective difference provides indirect support for the S/M spatial hypothesis: the discomfort tracks with S-cone stimulation geometry, not total photon flux.

**S-cone vulnerability to oxidative stress:**

The discomfort from frontal high-S/M light may have a protective basis. S-cones are uniquely vulnerable among photoreceptors:
- S-cones lack the protective macular pigment (lutein/zeaxanthin) that shields M- and L-cones from short-wavelength damage (Snodderly et al., 1984)
- S-cone photopigment absorbs the most energetic visible photons, generating more reactive oxygen species per photon absorbed
- S-cones are the first photoreceptors lost in age-related macular degeneration and other retinal pathologies (Curcio et al., 2000)
- Chronic short-wavelength exposure accelerates S-cone degeneration in animal models (Grimm et al., 2001)

Frontal monitor positioning delivers high-intensity 445nm light directly to the unprotected S-cone population in the fovea. The subjective harshness of this configuration may reflect a protective response to photoreceptors signaling oxidative stress. Overhead positioning reduces this direct assault by projecting the same spectrum to inferior retina where S-cone density is low.

This adds a photodamage dimension to the S/M spatial hypothesis: beyond the dopamine/satiety dysregulation, chronic frontal high-S/M exposure may accelerate S-cone degeneration, potentially contributing to early-onset visual pathology in heavy screen users.

**The vitamin D-S-cone protection paradox:**

Critically, vitamin D provides direct protection to cone cells against oxidative stress. Studies using the 661W cone cell line demonstrate that vitamin D:
- Increases cone cell viability under oxidative stress conditions
- Reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
- Restores expression of antioxidant genes
- Blocks oxidative damage pathways (Albert et al., 2016)

This creates a vicious cycle for chronic screen users:

| Factor | Effect | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| High-S/M monitor spectrum | Delivers oxidative stress to S-cones | Monitor light |
| Indoor screen time | Zero UVB exposure | Behavioral |
| Zero UVB | No vitamin D synthesis | Photochemical |
| Vitamin D deficiency | Reduced cone protection | Metabolic |
| Unprotected S-cones | Accelerated photodamage | Cumulative |

The screen user simultaneously:
1. **Delivers the assault**: 445nm light generating ROS in S-cones
2. **Removes the defense**: No UVB means no vitamin D to protect against oxidative damage

This may explain why heavy screen users report visual fatigue and discomfort disproportionate to light intensity-they are experiencing the compounding effect of S-cone oxidative stress without the vitamin D-mediated protection that outdoor light exposure would provide. The very behavior that causes the damage (screen use) prevents the protective response (vitamin D synthesis) that would mitigate it.

**The dark gaming room as worst case:**

The stereotypical gaming setup-monitor glowing in an otherwise dark room-represents the most extreme S/M dysregulation scenario:
- **Zero competing melanopsin input**: No overhead or ambient light to stimulate ipRGCs
- **Maximum S-cone stimulation**: Fovea receives undiluted high-S/M monitor spectrum
- **Extended duration**: Gaming sessions often exceed 4-8 hours
- **High engagement**: Attention locked to screen, minimizing even incidental peripheral light

This configuration delivers pure, uncompensated S-cone overstimulation with no melanopsin-mediated satiety signal. The phenomenology of compulsive gaming-inability to stop, constant "one more game" seeking, snacking without hunger satisfaction-aligns precisely with the "wanting without liking" state predicted by chronic high S/M exposure. The addictive quality attributed to game design may be substantially amplified by the photobiological environment in which gaming typically occurs.

**Practical implications:**
1. Ambient natural light from side windows improves circadian signaling but cannot rescue foveal S-cone overstimulation
2. **Overhead lighting may be more effective** than side windows for counteracting monitor-induced S/M dysregulation
3. **Dark room + screen is the worst possible configuration** for S/M balance-even dim overhead lighting provides some ipRGC input
4. Optimal workspace design should include bright overhead illumination with melanopic-appropriate spectrum
5. Solutions must still address the monitor spectrum itself for complete correction

### 4.8 Clinical Correlations

Epidemiological associations between screen time and various conditions may be explained by chronic S/M dysregulation:

**Table 8. Screen time associations potentially explained by S/M hypothesis**

| Condition | Association with Screen Time | S/M Mechanism |
|-----------|------------------------------|---------------|
| Obesity | Strong positive | Chronic hunger signaling |
| Binge eating | Strong positive | "Wanting" without satiety |
| ADHD symptoms | Strong positive | Dopamine dysregulation |
| Anxiety/restlessness | Positive | Chronic arousal, no satisfaction |
| Addiction patterns | Strong positive | Dopamine tolerance/seeking |
| Sleep disorders | Strong positive | Circadian + arousal disruption |
| Depression | Positive | Dopamine depletion after chronic elevation |

These associations are typically attributed to content (social media, gaming) or behavioral displacement (reduced exercise). The S/M hypothesis suggests a **photobiological mechanism independent of content**-the light itself may drive pathology regardless of what is displayed.

### 4.9 Why 445nm?

LED manufacturers use 445nm blue chips because:
1. High quantum efficiency at this wavelength
2. Optimal excitation of YAG phosphor
3. Good color gamut coverage
4. Historical precedent (InGaN technology)

Biological compatibility was not a design criterion. A shift to 460-470nm primary would:
- Reduce S/M ratio substantially
- Better engage melanopsin
- Maintain adequate color rendering
- Require phosphor reformulation (technically feasible)

### 4.10 Comparison: LED Types

**Table 9. Practical recommendations by S/M ratio**

| S/M Range | Sources | Biological Effect | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| < 0.7 | Incandescent, firelight | Sub-natural melanopsin emphasis | Evening appropriate |
| 0.7-1.0 | Warm LED, natural sun | Natural balance | General use |
| 1.0-1.13 | Natural shade maximum | Mild alerting | Acceptable |
| 1.13-1.5 | Cold LED | Above natural range | Minimize duration |
| 1.5-2.0 | Cold LED, some monitors | Significantly elevated | Avoid extended use |
| > 2.0 | Standard monitors | Extreme aberrant signal | **Strongly avoid** |

### 4.11 Method Validation: Weighted vs Unweighted S/M

To validate the band integration method, all spectral measurements were re-analyzed using CIE action spectrum weighting. Table 10 compares the two methods.

**Table 10. S/M ratio comparison: Band integration vs action spectrum weighting**

| Category | Band S/M Range | Weighted S/M Range | Correlation | Avg Shift |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Natural light | 0.69-1.13 | 0.43-0.69 | Preserved | -38% |
| Warm LED | 0.35-0.89 | 0.25-0.37 | Preserved | -51% |
| Cold LED | 1.20-1.93 | 0.55-0.68 | Preserved | -60% |
| Monitors | 1.33-2.90 | 0.32-0.74 | Preserved | -75% |

Key observations:
1. Action spectrum weighting reduces absolute S/M values across all categories
2. **Relative ordering is preserved**: Natural < Warm LED < Cold LED < Monitor
3. **Proportional excess is preserved**: Monitors still exceed natural maximum by 45-73% (weighted) vs 18-157% (band)
4. The biological conclusions remain valid under either method

The band integration method systematically overestimates S/M ratios, but maintains discriminative power for comparing light sources. This validation confirms that the qualitative findings-monitors produce aberrantly high S/M relative to natural light-hold under rigorous action spectrum analysis.

### 4.12 SAD Lamp Analysis: Bright S-cone Light Without Adequate Compensation

Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) lamps are designed to provide high-intensity light for mood regulation. Analysis of their spectral characteristics reveals a concerning pattern.

**Table 11. SAD lamp S/M ratios compared to natural light**

| Light Source | CCT (K) | S/M Ratio | vs Natural Max (1.13) |
|--------------|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| SAD Neutral | 4045 | 1.18 | +4% above |
| Lumie SAD Lamp | 4182 | 1.27 | +12% above |
| SAD Cold | 5673 | 1.43 | +27% above |
| Natural dawn | ~3500 | 0.69-0.85 | Reference |
| Natural midday shade | ~6500 | 1.00-1.13 | Reference |

All measured SAD lamps exceed the natural S/M maximum of 1.13. This creates a paradoxical situation:

**The fundamental problem**: SAD lamps deliver *bright* S-cone light, when natural dawn provides *dim* S-cone light. The natural morning pattern is:
- Low S/M ratio (0.69-0.85) at dawn
- Gradually increasing S/M as intensity increases
- S-cone activation rising in proportion to overall light level

SAD lamps invert this: high S/M ratio at therapeutic intensities (10,000 lux). This provides S-cone alerting signal without proportional melanopsin activation to balance it.

**Positioning compounds the problem**: SAD lamps are typically positioned:
- Frontally (on desk facing user)
- Laterally (beside workspace)

Both positions project light onto the fovea and parafovea where S-cones concentrate, while minimizing exposure to the inferior retina where ipRGCs are densest. This spatial geometry maximizes S/M ratio at the retinal level.

**Potential optimization strategies**:

1. **Time-restricted use**: SAD lamp S/M ratios may be appropriate only during the 6-8am window when natural light similarly provides elevated S-cone alerting
2. **Supplemental melanopic light**: Combine SAD lamp with overhead cyan/blue-enriched lighting to boost melanopsin activation
3. **Positional modification**: Mounting SAD lamps overhead rather than frontally would shift retinal projection toward ipRGC-rich regions
4. **Spectral redesign**: SAD lamp efficacy may improve with 470-490nm peak (melanopic) rather than current broad-spectrum designs

The current SAD lamp paradigm-bright, broad-spectrum, frontally-positioned light-may inadvertently create the S/M dysregulation pattern this paper identifies as problematic for appetite and dopamine regulation. This could explain why some SAD lamp users report increased appetite or carbohydrate cravings during light therapy.

### 4.13 Limitations

1. **No direct physiological measurement:** The hypothesis is based on spectral analysis and established neurobiology; direct measurement of hunger/dopamine under varying S/M conditions has not been performed.

2. **Individual variation:** Age, lens yellowing, prior light history, and chronotype affect photoreceptive responses.

3. **Content confounds:** Screen use involves content that independently affects dopamine; isolating spectral effects requires controlled studies.

4. **Single location:** Natural light measurements at one latitude/season; spectral composition varies geographically.

### 4.14 Future Directions

1. **Controlled feeding studies:** Measure hunger/satiety under matched-intensity light differing only in S/M ratio.

2. **Dopamine biomarkers:** Measure retinal and systemic dopamine metabolites under varying S/M conditions.

3. **Display technology development:** Prototype displays with 460-470nm primaries; assess S/M ratios and subjective effects.

4. **Epidemiological stratification:** Correlate obesity/addiction with screen spectral characteristics, not just duration.

5. **Therapeutic application:** Test low-S/M lighting for appetite disorders, addiction recovery, ADHD management.

## 5. Conclusions

Natural light maintains S-cone/melanopsin ratios within a narrow range (0.69-1.13) across all measured conditions from dawn to dusk. Modern LED displays produce S/M ratios of 1.3-2.9, exceeding natural maxima by up to 157%. Given established pathways connecting S-cone activation to retinal dopamine release and melanopsin to hypothalamic satiety circuits, chronic exposure to high-S/M light may produce sustained dopaminergic "wanting" without corresponding satisfaction signaling.

This S/M dysregulation hypothesis provides a photobiological mechanism potentially contributing to the observed associations between screen time and obesity, compulsive eating, attention disorders, and addictive behavior patterns. The mechanism operates independently of screen content-the spectral composition itself may drive pathology.

Display manufacturers should consider biological compatibility alongside technical performance. Shifting LED primaries from 445nm toward 460-470nm would reduce S/M ratios toward natural ranges with minimal impact on color rendering. Individual users can reduce S/M exposure by:
- Using warm/night modes that shift spectrum toward longer wavelengths
- Reducing screen time, particularly in evening hours
- Increasing natural light exposure to restore normal S/M patterns
- Selecting displays with longer-wavelength blue primaries when available

The human hypothalamus did not evolve to process S/M ratios of 2.9 for 8+ hours daily. The consequences of this evolutionary mismatch may include the modern epidemics of obesity, attention disorders, and behavioral addiction currently attributed to other causes.
