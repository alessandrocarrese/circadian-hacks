# S-cone to Melanopsin Ratio as a Determinant of Appetite and Dopaminergic Tone: Why Modern Display Technology May Drive Chronic Hunger and Compulsive Behavior

## Abstract

**Background:** Modern LED displays emit light with spectral peaks near 445nm, optimized for energy efficiency and color gamut rather than biological compatibility. The ratio of S-cone stimulation (420-460nm) to melanopsin stimulation (460-500nm) determines the balance between retinal dopamine release and hypothalamic satiety signaling. Natural light maintains S-cone/melanopsin (S/M) ratios between 0.69-1.13 across all conditions; modern displays routinely exceed 2.0, with some monitors reaching 2.9.

**Objectives:** (1) To characterize S/M ratios across natural light conditions and artificial sources; (2) To propose a neurobiological mechanism linking high S/M ratios to hunger, dopamine dysregulation, and compulsive behavior; (3) To quantify the departure of modern displays from evolutionary baselines.

**Methods:** Spectral power distributions (380-780nm) were measured for 33 natural light conditions and 24 artificial sources including LED bulbs and computer monitors. S-cone activation (420-460nm weighted) and melanopsin activation (460-500nm weighted) were calculated as percentages of total spectral power. S/M ratio was computed for each source.

**Results:** Natural light S/M ratios ranged from 0.69 (direct sun) to 1.13 (overcast sky), with mean 0.92. Natural light never exceeded S/M = 1.13 under any measured condition. Among artificial sources: warm LEDs (2700K) showed S/M 0.56-0.83; cold LEDs (6500K) showed S/M 1.20-1.88; computer monitors showed S/M 1.33-2.90. The highest-measured monitor (S/M = 2.90) exceeded the natural maximum by 157%.

**Conclusions:** Modern display technology produces S/M ratios far outside the evolutionary range. Given the established connections between S-cone activation and retinal dopamine release, and between melanopsin and hypothalamic satiety circuits, chronic exposure to high S/M light may produce a state of sustained dopaminergic "wanting" without corresponding "satisfaction" signaling. This mechanism may contribute to the observed associations between screen time and obesity, compulsive eating, attention disorders, and addictive behavior patterns. Display manufacturers should consider spectral optimization targeting S/M ratios below 1.0.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Spectral Environment and Human Physiology

Human physiology evolved under natural light characterized by predictable spectral composition varying with solar angle, atmospheric conditions, and time of day (Roenneberg & Foster, 1997). The visual and non-visual photoreceptive systems are tuned to this spectral environment, with distinct photoreceptor classes serving different physiological functions:

- **S-cones** (short-wavelength sensitive): Peak sensitivity ~440nm, primarily visual color discrimination, but also input to retinal dopaminergic circuits
- **Melanopsin-containing ipRGCs**: Peak sensitivity ~480nm, non-visual functions including circadian entrainment, pupillary response, and hypothalamic signaling
- **M-cones and L-cones**: Longer wavelength sensitivity, primarily visual function

The spectral composition of light-specifically the ratio of shorter to longer wavelengths within the blue-cyan range-determines the relative activation of these systems and consequently influences both visual processing and systemic physiology.

### 1.2 The Dopamine Connection

Retinal dopamine is synthesized and released by dopaminergic amacrine cells in the inner retina. These cells receive input from photoreceptors and modulate retinal function in response to light (Witkovsky, 2004). Critically, S-cone pathways provide significant input to dopaminergic amacrine cells, and short-wavelength light is a potent stimulus for retinal dopamine release (Nizar et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2012).

Retinal dopamine does not remain local. The retina has bidirectional communication with the hypothalamus via:
1. Direct ipRGC projections to hypothalamic nuclei (Hattar et al., 2006)
2. Dopaminergic modulation of ipRGC sensitivity and signaling (Van Hook et al., 2012)
3. Potential retrograde signaling affecting central dopaminergic tone

### 1.3 The Hypothalamic Appetite Network

The lateral hypothalamus (LH) contains orexin/hypocretin neurons that integrate:
- Light information (via ipRGC projections)
- Metabolic state
- Arousal level
- Reward/motivation signaling

Orexin neurons project to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the origin of mesolimbic dopamine pathways mediating reward and motivation (Harris & Aston-Jones, 2006). Activation of orexin neurons:
- Increases food-seeking behavior
- Enhances motivation and arousal
- Stimulates VTA dopamine release
- Promotes wakefulness

Importantly, melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs project directly to hypothalamic regions including areas adjacent to orexin neuron populations (Fernandez et al., 2018). This provides a pathway by which spectral composition of light can influence appetite and reward circuits.

### 1.4 The "Wanting" vs "Liking" Distinction

Berridge and Robinson's incentive salience theory distinguishes between:
- **Wanting** (dopamine-mediated): Motivation, craving, seeking behavior
- **Liking** (opioid-mediated): Pleasure, satisfaction, consummatory reward

Dopamine primarily drives "wanting"-the urge to seek and acquire-while the satisfaction of having acquired is mediated by separate opioid circuits (Berridge & Robinson, 1998). A system that stimulates "wanting" without enabling "liking" produces a state of perpetual unsatisfied craving.

### 1.5 Hypothesis

We hypothesize that the ratio of S-cone to melanopsin activation (S/M ratio) determines the balance between dopaminergic "wanting" signals and hypothalamic satiety/satisfaction signals. Natural light maintains S/M ratios within a narrow range (approximately 0.7-1.1) that produces balanced signaling. Modern artificial light sources, particularly LED displays with spectral peaks near 445nm, produce S/M ratios far exceeding natural ranges, potentially inducing chronic dopaminergic activation without corresponding satiety signaling-a neurobiological substrate for chronic hunger, craving, and compulsive behavior.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Spectral Measurements

Spectral power distributions were measured at a location in Southern Italy (41.0°N, 14.6°E) during December 2025 using a calibrated spectroradiometer (380-780nm, 1nm resolution). Measurements included:

**Natural light (n=33):**
- Dawn/sunrise conditions (n=6)
- Morning conditions (n=8)
- Noon conditions (n=4)
- Afternoon conditions (n=5)
- Sunset/dusk conditions (n=4)
- Indoor with natural light through windows (n=6)

**Artificial sources (n=24):**
- Warm LEDs, 2700K (n=8)
- Neutral LEDs, 4000-5000K (n=6)
- Cold LEDs, 6000-6500K (n=5)
- Computer monitors (n=3)
- Reference incandescent (n=1)
- Mixed/specialty sources (n=1)

### 2.2 Spectral Band Calculations

**S-cone activation percentage:** Integrated spectral power from 420-460nm as percentage of total power (380-780nm):

$$S_{cone}\% = \frac{\int_{420}^{460} S(\lambda) \, d\lambda}{\int_{380}^{780} S(\lambda) \, d\lambda} \times 100$$

**Melanopsin activation percentage:** Integrated spectral power from 460-500nm as percentage of total power:

$$Melanopsin\% = \frac{\int_{460}^{500} S(\lambda) \, d\lambda}{\int_{380}^{780} S(\lambda) \, d\lambda} \times 100$$

**S-cone/Melanopsin ratio (S/M):**

$$S/M = \frac{S_{cone}\%}{Melanopsin\%}$$

Note: These simplified band integrations approximate photoreceptor activation. Full analysis would weight by photoreceptor action spectra; however, the band integration method captures the essential spectral differences relevant to this analysis.

### 2.3 Blue Peak Identification

The wavelength of maximum spectral power within the 420-500nm range was identified for each source to characterize the spectral peak location.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Natural Light S/M Ratios

Table 1 presents S/M ratios across natural light conditions.

**Table 1. S-cone/Melanopsin ratios in natural light**

| Condition | n | S/M Range | S/M Mean ± SD | Blue Peak (nm) |
|-----------|---|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Dawn/Sunrise | 6 | 0.70-1.06 | 0.93 ± 0.14 | 450-465 |
| Morning | 8 | 0.77-1.13 | 0.91 ± 0.13 | 450-492 |
| Noon | 4 | 0.80-1.12 | 0.98 ± 0.15 | 403-491 |
| Afternoon | 5 | 0.79-0.89 | 0.84 ± 0.04 | 473-500 |
| Sunset/Dusk | 4 | 0.99-1.05 | 1.02 ± 0.03 | 451 |
| Indoor/Window | 6 | 0.69-0.99 | 0.83 ± 0.11 | 495-500 |
| **All Natural** | **33** | **0.69-1.13** | **0.92 ± 0.12** | - |

Critical finding: **No natural light condition exceeded S/M = 1.13**

### 3.2 Natural Light by Exposure Type

**Table 2. S/M ratios by natural light category**

| Category | S/M Range | S/M Mean | Interpretation |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Direct sun | 0.70-1.03 | 0.88 | Balanced, satiety-favoring |
| Shade/shadow | 1.00-1.12 | 1.04 | Slight S-cone emphasis |
| Sky only | 0.85-1.13 | 0.98 | Near-balanced |
| Tree shade | 1.02-1.05 | 1.03 | Slight S-cone emphasis |
| Building shade | 1.12 | 1.12 | Highest natural S/M |

Building shade (pure Rayleigh-scattered skylight, no direct sun) showed the highest natural S/M ratio at 1.12, representing the upper bound of natural exposure.

### 3.3 Artificial Light S/M Ratios

**Table 3. S-cone/Melanopsin ratios in artificial light sources**

| Source Category | n | S/M Range | S/M Mean ± SD | Blue Peak (nm) |
|-----------------|---|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Incandescent | 1 | 0.46 | - | 470 |
| Warm LED (2700K) | 8 | 0.56-0.83 | 0.72 ± 0.11 | 451-457 |
| Neutral LED (4000-5000K) | 6 | 0.79-1.00 | 0.88 ± 0.09 | 450-470 |
| Cold LED (6000-6500K) | 5 | 1.20-1.88 | 1.45 ± 0.30 | 448-452 |
| Computer monitors | 2 | 1.33-2.90 | 2.12 ± 1.11 | 446-448 |

### 3.4 Monitor Analysis

**Table 4. Computer monitor spectral characteristics**

| Monitor | Blue Peak | S-cone % | Melanopsin % | S/M Ratio | vs Natural Max |
|---------|-----------|----------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| Monitor (low blue) | 446nm | 19.10 | 14.39 | 1.33 | +18% |
| Monitor (cool/normal) | 446nm | 21.18 | 7.30 | 2.90 | **+157%** |

The standard "cool" monitor mode produced S/M ratio of 2.90, exceeding the natural maximum (1.13) by 157%.

### 3.5 Spectral Peak Analysis

**Table 5. Blue peak wavelength by source type**

| Source Type | Blue Peak Range | S/M Correlation |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Natural light | 403-500nm | Variable |
| Warm LED | 451-457nm | S/M 0.56-0.83 |
| Cold LED | 448-452nm | S/M 1.20-1.88 |
| Computer monitor | 445-448nm | S/M 1.33-2.90 |

Key finding: Monitors with peaks at 445-448nm showed the highest S/M ratios due to:
1. Peak positioned at S-cone maximum sensitivity (~440nm)
2. Sharp spectral falloff reducing melanopsin activation
3. Minimal emission in cyan (470-500nm) range

### 3.6 S-cone Sensitivity at Key Wavelengths

S-cone sensitivity was modeled as Gaussian function peaking at 440nm (σ ≈ 20nm):

**Table 6. Relative S-cone sensitivity by wavelength**

| Wavelength | Relative S-cone Sensitivity |
|------------|----------------------------|
| 440nm | 1.000 (maximum) |
| 445nm | 0.969 |
| 448nm | 0.923 |
| 451nm | 0.860 |
| 454nm | 0.783 |
| 460nm | 0.607 |
| 480nm | 0.135 |

A display peak at 445nm produces 7.2× more S-cone activation than melanopsin activation at 480nm, compared to 1.4× at 460nm-a 5-fold difference in S/M drive.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 The Natural S/M Range

Across 33 natural light measurements spanning dawn to dusk, direct sun to deep shade, the S/M ratio remained within a remarkably narrow range: **0.69-1.13**. This range presumably represents the spectral environment under which human photoreceptive and hypothalamic systems evolved over millions of years.

The highest natural S/M (1.12-1.13) occurred in:
- Building shade (pure skylight)
- Morning sky only (Rayleigh-dominated)
- Twilight conditions

These represent natural contexts where slightly elevated alertness and food-seeking would be adaptive (morning activation, evening last-meal preparation). Even these conditions remained at or below S/M = 1.13.

### 4.2 Artificial Light Exceeds Natural Bounds

Cold LEDs and computer monitors routinely exceed natural S/M maxima:

| Source | S/M Ratio | Exceeds Natural Max By |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| Cold LED (typical) | 1.45 | +28% |
| Cold LED (high) | 1.88 | +66% |
| Monitor (cool) | 2.90 | +157% |

A standard computer monitor in normal mode produces S/M signals **2.5× higher** than any natural condition ever measured.

### 4.3 The Neurobiological Mechanism

We propose the following pathway linking high S/M ratios to hunger and compulsive behavior:

**Step 1: S-cone Activation → Retinal Dopamine**
- 445nm light maximally stimulates S-cones
- S-cones synapse with dopaminergic amacrine cells
- High S-cone activation → elevated retinal dopamine release
- Retinal dopamine modulates ipRGC signaling to hypothalamus

**Step 2: Reduced Melanopsin Activation → Impaired Satiety Signaling**
- 445nm poorly stimulates melanopsin (peak 480nm)
- Melanopsin ipRGCs project to hypothalamic satiety centers
- Low melanopsin activation → reduced "satisfaction" signal
- SCN circadian signal also impaired

**Step 3: Hypothalamic Integration → Orexin Activation**
- High dopamine + low satiety = net orexin activation
- Orexin neurons interpret this as "twilight foraging" state
- Downstream activation of VTA dopamine (wanting)
- Increased food-seeking, motivation, arousal

**Step 4: Chronic Exposure → Dysregulation**
- 8+ hours/day of S/M > 2.0
- Continuous "wanting" signal without "satisfied" resolution
- Dopamine system downregulation (tolerance)
- Escalating stimulation required for baseline function
- Pattern resembles addiction neurobiology

### 4.4 "Wanting" Without "Liking"

The S/M imbalance may specifically dissociate wanting from liking:

| Signal | Pathway | Effect of High S/M |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Wanting | Dopamine (VTA) | ↑↑↑ Elevated |
| Liking | Opioid | → Unchanged |
| Satiety | Melanopsin→Hypothalamus | ↓↓ Suppressed |

This produces the characteristic phenomenology of:
- Eating without hunger satisfaction
- Scrolling without content satisfaction
- Seeking without finding
- Craving without fulfillment

### 4.5 Temporal Dynamics: The All-Day Problem

Natural light S/M varies across the day:

```
Dawn:      S/M ~1.0  → "Wake, seek breakfast"
Morning:   S/M ~0.85 → "Active, fed, productive"
Noon:      S/M ~0.80 → "Satiated, rest period"
Afternoon: S/M ~0.85 → "Active, moderate hunger"
Dusk:      S/M ~1.0  → "Final meal, wind down"
Night:     S/M → 0   → "Sleep, fast, restore"
```

Monitor use imposes static S/M ~2.9 for 8-12+ hours:

```
All day:   S/M 2.9   → "SEEK SEEK SEEK SEEK SEEK"
Night:     S/M 2.9   → "SEEK" (when expecting 0)
```

The circadian variation in S/M ratio may itself be a biological signal-the trajectory indicating time-of-day. Static high S/M eliminates this signal, producing:
1. Loss of temporal appetite regulation
2. Loss of circadian metabolic cues
3. Continuous foraging activation
4. No fasting/restoration period

### 4.6 Cumulative Dose

Over extended exposure periods, the cumulative excess becomes substantial:

**Table 7. Cumulative S/M exposure estimates**

| Exposure | Natural | Monitor (S/M 2.9) | Excess |
|----------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 hour | 0.92 | 2.90 | +215% |
| 8 hours | 7.4 | 23.2 | +214% |
| 1 year (8h/day) | 2,700 | 8,470 | +5,770 |
| 10 years | 27,000 | 84,700 | +57,700 |

Chronic exposure accumulates a massive excess of high-S/M stimulation with unknown but potentially significant long-term neurobiological effects.

### 4.7 Clinical Correlations

Epidemiological associations between screen time and various conditions may be explained by chronic S/M dysregulation:

**Table 8. Screen time associations potentially explained by S/M hypothesis**

| Condition | Association with Screen Time | S/M Mechanism |
|-----------|------------------------------|---------------|
| Obesity | Strong positive | Chronic hunger signaling |
| Binge eating | Strong positive | "Wanting" without satiety |
| ADHD symptoms | Strong positive | Dopamine dysregulation |
| Anxiety/restlessness | Positive | Chronic arousal, no satisfaction |
| Addiction patterns | Strong positive | Dopamine tolerance/seeking |
| Sleep disorders | Strong positive | Circadian + arousal disruption |
| Depression | Positive | Dopamine depletion after chronic elevation |

These associations are typically attributed to content (social media, gaming) or behavioral displacement (reduced exercise). The S/M hypothesis suggests a **photobiological mechanism independent of content**-the light itself may drive pathology regardless of what is displayed.

### 4.8 Why 445nm?

LED manufacturers use 445nm blue chips because:
1. High quantum efficiency at this wavelength
2. Optimal excitation of YAG phosphor
3. Good color gamut coverage
4. Historical precedent (InGaN technology)

Biological compatibility was not a design criterion. A shift to 460-470nm primary would:
- Reduce S/M ratio substantially
- Better engage melanopsin
- Maintain adequate color rendering
- Require phosphor reformulation (technically feasible)

### 4.9 Comparison: LED Types

**Table 9. Practical recommendations by S/M ratio**

| S/M Range | Sources | Biological Effect | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| < 0.7 | Incandescent, firelight | Sub-natural melanopsin emphasis | Evening appropriate |
| 0.7-1.0 | Warm LED, natural sun | Natural balance | General use |
| 1.0-1.13 | Natural shade maximum | Mild alerting | Acceptable |
| 1.13-1.5 | Cold LED | Above natural range | Minimize duration |
| 1.5-2.0 | Cold LED, some monitors | Significantly elevated | Avoid extended use |
| > 2.0 | Standard monitors | Extreme aberrant signal | **Strongly avoid** |

### 4.10 Limitations

1. **Simplified band integration:** True photoreceptor activation requires action spectrum weighting; band integration approximates this.

2. **No direct physiological measurement:** The hypothesis is based on spectral analysis and established neurobiology; direct measurement of hunger/dopamine under varying S/M conditions has not been performed.

3. **Individual variation:** Age, lens yellowing, prior light history, and chronotype affect photoreceptive responses.

4. **Content confounds:** Screen use involves content that independently affects dopamine; isolating spectral effects requires controlled studies.

5. **Single location:** Natural light measurements at one latitude/season; spectral composition varies geographically.

### 4.11 Future Directions

1. **Controlled feeding studies:** Measure hunger/satiety under matched-intensity light differing only in S/M ratio.

2. **Dopamine biomarkers:** Measure retinal and systemic dopamine metabolites under varying S/M conditions.

3. **Display technology development:** Prototype displays with 460-470nm primaries; assess S/M ratios and subjective effects.

4. **Epidemiological stratification:** Correlate obesity/addiction with screen spectral characteristics, not just duration.

5. **Therapeutic application:** Test low-S/M lighting for appetite disorders, addiction recovery, ADHD management.

## 5. Conclusions

Natural light maintains S-cone/melanopsin ratios within a narrow range (0.69-1.13) across all measured conditions from dawn to dusk. Modern LED displays produce S/M ratios of 1.3-2.9, exceeding natural maxima by up to 157%. Given established pathways connecting S-cone activation to retinal dopamine release and melanopsin to hypothalamic satiety circuits, chronic exposure to high-S/M light may produce sustained dopaminergic "wanting" without corresponding satisfaction signaling.

This S/M dysregulation hypothesis provides a photobiological mechanism potentially contributing to the observed associations between screen time and obesity, compulsive eating, attention disorders, and addictive behavior patterns. The mechanism operates independently of screen content-the spectral composition itself may drive pathology.

Display manufacturers should consider biological compatibility alongside technical performance. Shifting LED primaries from 445nm toward 460-470nm would reduce S/M ratios toward natural ranges with minimal impact on color rendering. Individual users can reduce S/M exposure by:
- Using warm/night modes that shift spectrum toward longer wavelengths
- Reducing screen time, particularly in evening hours
- Increasing natural light exposure to restore normal S/M patterns
- Selecting displays with longer-wavelength blue primaries when available

The human hypothalamus did not evolve to process S/M ratios of 2.9 for 8+ hours daily. The consequences of this evolutionary mismatch may include the modern epidemics of obesity, attention disorders, and behavioral addiction currently attributed to other causes.
