# Near-Infrared Transmission Characteristics of Architectural Glazing: Comparing Historical and Modern Window Technologies

## Abstract

**Background:** Modern energy-efficient window glazing incorporates low-emissivity (Low-E) coatings designed to reduce infrared heat transfer. While the thermal benefits are well documented, the effects on transmission of biologically relevant near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths have received less attention.

**Objective:** To compare near-infrared transmission characteristics of modern Low-E double-pane windows with historical single-pane glass, and to assess implications for indoor light quality.

**Methods:** Spectral power distributions (380-780nm) of natural daylight were measured through three glazing conditions: unobstructed outdoor, through vintage single-pane glass (~1950s), and through modern Low-E double-pane glass. NIR content (700-780nm), visible content (380-700nm), and Spectral Protection Ratio (SPR) were calculated for each condition.

**Results:** Modern Low-E windows blocked 61% of NIR radiation while blocking only 53% of visible light, creating an 8.4 percentage point "NIR deficit." Vintage single-pane glass showed 81.6% NIR transmission with only 3.8% NIR deficit relative to visible light. SPR decreased from 3.56 (outdoor) to 3.09 (modern window), representing a 13% reduction in red/NIR to blue balance.

**Conclusions:** Modern Low-E window coatings preferentially block NIR relative to visible light, creating an indoor spectral environment depleted in potentially beneficial long wavelengths. If NIR has photobiomodulation effects in humans, widespread adoption of Low-E glazing may have unintended consequences for indoor light quality. Historical single-pane glass better preserves the spectral balance of outdoor light.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Evolution of Architectural Glazing

Window glass technology has evolved substantially over the past century. Historical single-pane glass, common through the mid-20th century, consisted of simple float glass with relatively uniform transmission across the visible and near-infrared spectrum (Pilkington, 1959).

Modern glazing systems incorporate multiple innovations:
- **Double or triple panes** with insulating gas fill
- **Low-emissivity (Low-E) coatings** that reflect infrared radiation
- **Spectrally selective coatings** that maximize visible transmission while minimizing infrared

These technologies significantly improve thermal performance, reducing heating and cooling energy consumption by 30-50% compared to single-pane glass (Carmody et al., 2004).

### 1.2 Low-E Coating Mechanism

Low-E coatings consist of thin metallic or metallic oxide layers (typically silver or tin oxide) applied to glass surfaces. These coatings are designed to:
- Transmit visible light (400-700nm)
- Reflect long-wave infrared (thermal radiation, >2500nm)
- Block or reflect near-infrared solar radiation (700-2500nm)

The goal is to admit visible light for illumination while rejecting infrared that contributes to solar heat gain (in cooling climates) or heat loss (in heating climates).

### 1.3 Near-Infrared and Human Biology

While the thermal engineering objectives of Low-E coatings are well-established, the biological implications of NIR filtering have received less attention. Near-infrared radiation (700-1400nm) has documented biological effects:

- **Photobiomodulation:** NIR absorption by cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondria influences cellular metabolism (Karu, 2010)
- **Preconditioning:** NIR exposure before UV can reduce subsequent photodamage (Menezes et al., 1998)
- **Tissue healing:** Clinical applications of NIR for wound healing and tissue repair (Hamblin, 2016)

If chronic NIR exposure contributes to normal tissue maintenance, indoor environments depleted in NIR may constitute a form of spectral deprivation.

### 1.4 Study Objective

This study compares NIR transmission characteristics of modern Low-E double-pane windows with vintage single-pane glass, quantifying the "NIR deficit" introduced by modern glazing technology.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Glazing Samples

Three glazing conditions were compared:

1. **Unobstructed outdoor:** No glazing (reference condition)
2. **Vintage single-pane:** Residential window glass from approximately 1950s construction, clear float glass, 4mm thickness
3. **Modern Low-E double-pane:** Contemporary residential window with argon-filled gap and Low-E coating on surface 2 (interior-facing surface of outer pane), 4mm-12mm-4mm configuration

### 2.2 Measurement Protocol

Spectral power distributions were measured using calibrated spectroradiometry (380-780nm, 1nm resolution) under identical outdoor lighting conditions:
- Time: Mid-morning, clear sky
- Location: Southern Italy, 41°N (Limatola)
- Sensor position: Identical distance and angle from each glazing sample
- Sequential measurements within 10-minute period to minimize lighting variation

### 2.3 Spectral Analysis

For each condition, the following parameters were calculated:

**Total visible (380-700nm):** Integrated spectral power in visible range

**NIR content (700-780nm):** Integrated spectral power in measured NIR range, expressed as:
- Absolute power (μW/cm²)
- Percentage of total power
- Transmission relative to outdoor reference

**NIR deficit:** Defined as the difference between visible transmission and NIR transmission:
$$NIR_{deficit} = T_{visible} - T_{NIR}$$
where T is transmission as fraction of outdoor reference.

Positive values indicate preferential NIR blocking relative to visible.

**Spectral Protection Ratio (SPR):**
$$SPR = \frac{Red (620-700nm) + NIR (700-780nm)}{Blue (430-470nm)}$$

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Transmission Characteristics

Table 1 presents transmission characteristics for each glazing condition.

**Table 1. Spectral transmission by glazing type**

| Parameter | Outdoor | Vintage Single | Modern Low-E |
|-----------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Illuminance (lux) | 3,279 | 2,678 | 1,527 |
| Visible transmission | 100% | 81.7% | 46.6% |
| NIR transmission (700-780nm) | 100% | 77.9% | 38.2% |
| NIR % of total power | 17.4% | 16.7% | 14.3% |
| NIR deficit | — | 3.8% | 8.4% |
| SPR | 3.56 | 3.42 | 3.09 |

### 3.2 Wavelength-Specific Transmission

Figure 1 (described) would show transmission curves:
- Vintage single-pane: Relatively flat transmission ~80% across 380-780nm
- Modern Low-E: Higher transmission in visible (~55% at 550nm), declining to <40% at 700nm and ~30% at 780nm

**Table 2. Band-specific transmission comparison**

| Wavelength Band | Vintage Single | Modern Low-E |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| UV/Violet (380-420nm) | 78% | 42% |
| Blue (430-470nm) | 82% | 48% |
| Green (520-560nm) | 83% | 55% |
| Red (620-700nm) | 80% | 44% |
| NIR (700-780nm) | 78% | 38% |

Modern Low-E shows progressively declining transmission toward longer wavelengths, with NIR transmission 21% lower than green transmission.

### 3.3 NIR Deficit Impact

The 8.4% NIR deficit in modern windows translates to:
- Relative NIR content: 14.3% (modern) vs 17.4% (outdoor), a 3.1 percentage point reduction
- SPR reduction: 3.56 → 3.09, a 13% decrease
- Blue:NIR ratio shift: Blue relatively enhanced compared to NIR

### 3.4 Comparison with LED Sources

For context, Table 3 compares window-filtered natural light with artificial sources.

**Table 3. NIR content comparison across light sources**

| Source | NIR % (700-780nm) | SPR |
|--------|-------------------|-----|
| Natural outdoor | 17.4% | 3.56 |
| Through vintage window | 16.7% | 3.42 |
| Through modern Low-E | 14.3% | 3.09 |
| Warm LED (2700K) | 5.8% | 5.42 |
| Cold LED (6500K) | 0.8% | 0.68 |

Even the NIR-depleted light through modern windows contains more NIR than the best LED sources.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 The NIR Deficit as Unintended Consequence

Low-E coating technology was developed to improve thermal performance, and the NIR blocking is a direct consequence of this goal—NIR solar radiation contributes to solar heat gain. However, the biological implications of chronic NIR deprivation were not considered in coating design.

The 8.4% NIR deficit in modern Low-E windows means that indoor light is spectrally different from outdoor light in ways that may affect:
- Photobiomodulation-mediated cellular processes
- Spectral cues used by circadian and other photoreceptive systems
- The balance between potentially damaging (blue) and protective (red/NIR) wavelengths

### 4.2 Historical Glass Preserves Spectral Balance

Vintage single-pane glass showed only 3.8% NIR deficit, indicating relatively uniform transmission across the spectrum. Historical indoor environments, while lower in total illuminance than outdoors, preserved the spectral composition of natural light more faithfully than modern glazing.

This suggests that the transition from single-pane to Low-E glazing (widespread since the 1990s) represents a change not only in thermal characteristics but also in the spectral quality of indoor light.

### 4.3 Combined Effects with LED Lighting

Modern indoor environments often combine:
- Low-E windows (NIR-depleted natural light)
- LED lighting (essentially zero NIR)
- Limited outdoor exposure

The cumulative effect is an unprecedented reduction in NIR exposure compared to historical or outdoor environments. Whether this matters for human health depends on the role of chronic NIR exposure in normal physiology—a question that remains incompletely answered.

### 4.4 Implications for Building Design

If NIR has beneficial effects, building designers face a trade-off:
- **Thermal efficiency:** Low-E coatings reduce energy consumption
- **Spectral quality:** Low-E coatings reduce potentially beneficial NIR

Possible mitigation strategies include:
- Spectrally selective coatings that preserve 700-850nm (therapeutic window) while blocking >1000nm (thermal)
- NIR-transmitting skylights or windows in specific areas
- Supplemental NIR lighting in indoor spaces

These considerations have not been incorporated into green building standards (LEED, BREEAM, WELL), which focus on daylight quantity rather than spectral quality.

### 4.5 Limitations

1. **Limited NIR range:** Measurement range (700-780nm) captures only partial NIR; true NIR extends to 1400nm or beyond.

2. **Single sample comparison:** One vintage and one modern window were compared; variation exists within each category.

3. **No biological validation:** Spectral differences were characterized; health effects were not measured.

4. **Measurement geometry:** Transmission may vary with angle of incidence.

5. **Coating variation:** Multiple Low-E coating formulations exist with different spectral characteristics.

### 4.6 Future Research

1. **Extended NIR measurement:** Characterize transmission to 1000nm or beyond to capture full photobiomodulation-relevant range.

2. **Coating optimization:** Develop Low-E coatings that preserve 700-850nm therapeutic window while blocking thermal IR.

3. **Epidemiological studies:** Compare health outcomes in populations with different window types (controlling for other factors).

4. **Physiological studies:** Measure markers of mitochondrial function in subjects with high versus low NIR exposure.

## 5. Conclusions

Modern Low-E window glazing blocks 61% of near-infrared radiation while blocking only 53% of visible light, creating an 8.4 percentage point NIR deficit compared to historical single-pane glass. The SPR (red+NIR to blue ratio) decreases by 13% through modern windows compared to unobstructed outdoor light.

This preferential NIR blocking is an unintended consequence of thermal optimization in Low-E coating design. If near-infrared radiation has photobiomodulation effects in humans, the widespread adoption of energy-efficient glazing may have created indoor environments with reduced spectral quality despite improved thermal performance.

Building designers and standards organizations should consider spectral quality alongside thermal efficiency in glazing specification. Historical single-pane glass, while thermally inferior, better preserves the spectral balance of natural light that human physiology evolved with.
