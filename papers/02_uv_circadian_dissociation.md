# UV-Circadian Signal Dissociation Induced by Corrective Eyewear: Implications for Neuropsin (OPN5) Signaling and Myopia Prevention

## Abstract

**Background:** Corrective eyeglasses filter ultraviolet (UV) radiation while transmitting visible light. Recent identification of neuropsin (OPN5) as a UV-sensitive opsin involved in eye development and myopia prevention raises questions about the biological consequences of chronic UV filtering in eyeglass wearers.

**Objective:** To quantify spectral filtering effects of standard corrective eyeglasses on UV, visible, and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, and to characterize the resulting dissociation between UV markers and circadian-relevant visible wavelengths.

**Methods:** Spectral power distributions (380-780nm) of natural daylight were measured under three conditions: unfiltered (baseline), through corrective eyeglasses only, and through eyeglasses plus modern double-pane window glass. UV content, S-cone activation, melanopic activation, and Spectral Protection Ratio (SPR) were calculated for each condition.

**Results:** Corrective eyeglasses blocked 79% of UV/violet radiation (380-420nm) while paradoxically increasing melanopic activation by 22% and S-cone activation by 16% due to anti-reflective coating effects. This creates a 5.5-fold "dissociation ratio" between UV blocking and circadian signal enhancement. Combined eyeglasses plus window filtering blocked 94% of UV while maintaining enhanced circadian wavelengths. The spectral region affected by eyeglass filtering (380-420nm) overlaps precisely with the reported peak sensitivity of OPN5 (neuropsin) at 380nm.

**Conclusions:** Standard corrective eyeglasses create an unprecedented dissociation between UV and circadian wavelengths that does not occur in natural unfiltered light. Given emerging evidence that OPN5 signaling at 380nm is required for myopia prevention, chronic UV filtering in eyeglass-wearing populations may constitute a previously unrecognized risk factor for myopia progression. Further epidemiological and mechanistic research is warranted.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Human photoreception extends beyond the classical visual pathway to include multiple non-visual opsins with distinct spectral sensitivities and physiological functions (Do & Yau, 2010). While melanopsin (OPN4, peak ~480nm) in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) has been extensively characterized for its role in circadian photoentrainment (Berson et al., 2002), other non-visual opsins remain less well understood.

Neuropsin (OPN5) represents a UV-sensitive opsin with peak sensitivity at approximately 380nm, expressed in the retina, cornea, and other ocular tissues (Kojima et al., 2011). Recent research has identified a critical role for OPN5 in eye development and myopia prevention. Torii et al. (2017) demonstrated that violet light (360-400nm) exposure suppresses lens-induced myopia in chicks and mice through an OPN5-dependent mechanism. Crucially, this protective effect was abolished in OPN5 knockout animals, establishing OPN5 as necessary for violet light-mediated myopia control.

### 1.2 The Myopia Epidemic

Myopia prevalence has increased dramatically in recent decades, particularly in East Asian populations where rates exceed 80% among young adults (Holden et al., 2016). While genetic factors contribute, the rapid increase suggests environmental causation. Outdoor time has been consistently associated with reduced myopia risk (Rose et al., 2008), but the protective mechanism remains debated. Proposed factors include higher illuminance levels, greater viewing distances, and specific spectral characteristics of outdoor light.

The identification of OPN5-mediated violet light signaling as protective against myopia raises a concerning hypothesis: modern lifestyle factors that specifically filter violet/UV wavelengths while maintaining visible light exposure may disrupt this protective pathway.

### 1.3 Corrective Eyeglasses as UV Filters

Standard corrective eyeglass lenses, including both glass and polycarbonate materials, incorporate UV-blocking compounds to protect against photokeratitis and presumed cumulative UV damage (Mainster & Turner, 2010). These lenses typically block wavelengths below 400nm with high efficiency. However, the biological consequences of chronic UV blocking in the context of OPN5 signaling have not been examined.

We hypothesized that corrective eyeglasses would create a dissociation between UV wavelengths (blocked) and circadian-relevant visible wavelengths (transmitted), resulting in an unnatural spectral pattern that does not occur in the outdoor environment in which human photoreception evolved.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Measurement Conditions

Spectral power distributions were measured under natural daylight conditions (mid-morning, clear sky, Southern Italy 41°N, Limatola) under three filtering conditions:

1. **Baseline (unfiltered):** Open window, no eyeglasses
2. **Eyeglasses only:** Standard polycarbonate prescription lenses with anti-reflective coating
3. **Eyeglasses + window:** Standard eyeglasses viewed through modern Low-E double-pane window glass

All measurements were obtained within a 15-minute period to minimize variation in solar conditions.

### 2.2 Spectral Analysis

Measurements were obtained using a calibrated spectroradiometer (Sekonic C-800) covering 380-780nm at 1nm resolution. For each condition, the following parameters were calculated:

**UV/Violet content:** Integrated power in 380-420nm band as percentage of total spectrum

**S-cone activation:** Weighted by Stockman & Sharpe (2000) S-cone fundamental

**Melanopic activation:** Weighted by CIE S 026 melanopic action spectrum (CIE, 2018)

**SPR (Spectral Protection Ratio):** (Red 620-700nm + NIR 700-780nm) / Blue 430-470nm

**UV-Circadian Dissociation Ratio:** Defined as the ratio of circadian signal enhancement to UV blocking:

$$Dissociation = \frac{(Melanopsin_{filtered} / Melanopsin_{unfiltered})}{(UV_{filtered} / UV_{unfiltered})}$$

Values >1.0 indicate dissociation (enhanced circadian signal with reduced UV).

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Spectral Filtering Effects

Table 1 presents the spectral characteristics under each filtering condition.

**Table 1. Spectral parameters under progressive filtering conditions**

| Parameter | Unfiltered | Eyeglasses | Glasses + Window |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------------|
| Illuminance (lux) | 3,279 | 3,964 | 2,865 |
| CCT (K) | 5,856 | 5,675 | 5,971 |
| UV/Violet % (380-420nm) | 3.82 | 0.80 | 0.24 |
| UV block vs baseline | - | 79% | 94% |
| S-cone % | 9.02 | 10.45 | 9.43 |
| S-cone change | - | +16% | +5% |
| Melanopsin % | 9.51 | 11.56 | 10.56 |
| Melanopsin change | - | +22% | +11% |
| SPR | 3.56 | 3.64 | 3.09 |
| Blue:Red ratio | 0.52 | 0.51 | 0.58 |

### 3.2 UV-Circadian Dissociation

The UV-circadian dissociation ratio quantifies the degree to which circadian signals are maintained or enhanced while UV is blocked:

**Eyeglasses only:**
- UV transmission: 21% (79% blocked)
- Melanopsin enhancement: 122% of baseline
- Dissociation ratio: 1.22 / 0.21 = **5.8×**

**Eyeglasses + window:**
- UV transmission: 6% (94% blocked)
- Melanopsin: 111% of baseline
- Dissociation ratio: 1.11 / 0.06 = **18.5×**

### 3.3 Wavelength-Specific Transmission

Analysis of wavelength-specific transmission revealed selective filtering:

**Table 2. Band-specific transmission through corrective eyeglasses**

| Wavelength Band | Transmission | Change vs Baseline |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| UV/Violet (380-420nm) | 21% | -79% |
| S-cone peak (420-460nm) | 116% | +16% |
| Melanopsin peak (470-490nm) | 122% | +22% |
| Red (620-700nm) | 118% | +18% |
| NIR (700-780nm) | 107% | +7% |

The paradoxical increase in visible light transmission despite filtering is attributable to anti-reflective (AR) coating technology, which reduces surface reflections and increases net transmission in the visible range while UV-blocking compounds eliminate short-wavelength transmission.

### 3.4 OPN5 Sensitivity Overlap

The spectral sensitivity of OPN5 (neuropsin), as characterized by Kojima et al. (2011), peaks at approximately 380nm with half-maximum sensitivity extending to approximately 420nm. This precisely overlaps the wavelength range most affected by eyeglass filtering (79% blocked in 380-420nm range).

---

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 An Unprecedented Spectral Pattern

These data reveal that corrective eyeglasses create a spectral pattern that does not occur in the natural environment: enhanced circadian-relevant wavelengths (S-cone, melanopsin) combined with near-complete elimination of UV wavelengths.

In natural outdoor light, UV, violet, blue, and longer wavelengths rise and fall together throughout the day. At dawn, all wavelengths are low; at midday, all are high; at dusk, all decline together. This coherent pattern provides multiple redundant time-of-day signals to photoreceptive systems.

Eyeglasses disrupt this coherence, creating a situation where the brain receives:
- Strong S-cone signal (16% enhanced)
- Strong melanopsin signal (22% enhanced)
- Minimal OPN5 signal (79% reduced)

This represents a 5.8-fold dissociation between OPN5-relevant and melanopsin-relevant wavelengths.

### 4.2 Implications for OPN5 Signaling

OPN5 (neuropsin) has been implicated in multiple physiological processes:

1. **Myopia prevention:** Torii et al. (2017) demonstrated that violet light (360-400nm) suppresses experimental myopia through OPN5. OPN5 knockout mice showed no protective effect of violet light exposure.

2. **Retinal dopamine regulation:** OPN5 modulates dopamine release in the retina (Buhr et al., 2015), and dopamine signaling is implicated in myopia development (Feldkaemper & Schaeffel, 2013).

3. **Vascular development:** OPN5 in retinal vascular endothelium influences vessel development and regression (Nguyen et al., 2019).

4. **Thermoregulation and arousal:** OPN5 is expressed in the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus, a region critical for sleep-wake regulation and thermoregulation (Zhang et al., 2020). OPN5-expressing neurons in the POA are part of the QPLOT neuronal population that regulates core body temperature and energy expenditure. Human OPN5 preferentially activates Gq-mediated Ca²⁺ signaling, potentially contributing to arousal pathways.

5. **Circadian photoentrainment:** OPN5 is required for local circadian oscillator entrainment in the retina, cornea, and skin (Buhr et al., 2015; Sikka et al., 2019).

6. **Lipid metabolism:** OPN5-mediated light detection in brown adipose tissue (BAT) influences thermogenesis and lipid metabolism, potentially linking light exposure to metabolic regulation (Zhang et al., 2020).

Chronic reduction of OPN5 stimulation due to eyeglass-induced UV filtering may therefore affect multiple aspects of ocular development, circadian function, arousal, and metabolism.

### 4.3 OPN5 Bistable Photochemistry and the Dawn Burst

OPN5 is a bistable photopigment with unique temporal dynamics that distinguish it from melanopsin and other visual opsins:

**Bistable mechanism:**
- **Activation state:** 380nm absorption triggers Gq signaling cascade
- **Meta-stable state:** After activation, chromophore converts to 470nm-absorbing form
- **Reset mechanism:** Orange light (>520nm) reverts chromophore to 380nm-absorbing ground state
- **Dark stability:** Unlike bleaching visual opsins, bistable OPN5 remains in either state indefinitely in darkness

**Diurnal sensitivity cycle:**

| Time Period | OPN5 State | Sensitivity to 380nm |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| Night/sleep | Accumulated pool | Maximum |
| Dawn | Firing | Rapid activation |
| Morning | Partially depleted | Decreasing |
| Midday | Orange-reset | Regenerating |
| Afternoon | Mixed pool | Moderate |
| Dusk | Partially reset | Moderate-high |

**The dawn burst phenomenon:**

During overnight sleep in darkness, OPN5 molecules accumulate in the resting (380nm-sensitive) state. The first 380nm exposure at dawn triggers a synchronized "burst" of OPN5 activation—potentially explaining why dawn light produces subjectively stronger alerting effects than equivalent light later in the day.

This bistable cycling has important implications for eyeglass wearers:
- Glasses blocking 380nm eliminate the dawn burst entirely
- Later in the day, natural orange light resets OPN5 pool, so glasses cause less relative deprivation
- The **first 30 minutes of light exposure** represent the critical window when glasses cause maximum OPN5 signal loss

### 4.4 Glasses vs Window Glass: Differential OPN5 Blocking

Not all optical barriers are equivalent for OPN5 signaling:

**Table 4. OPN5-weighted transmission through different barriers**

| Barrier | 380nm Transmission | OPN5-Weighted Block |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Standard eyeglasses | 6% | 81% |
| Modern Low-E window | 77% | 23% |
| Window + glasses | 5% | 94% |

Eyeglasses are the primary barrier to OPN5 activation—blocking 3.5× more OPN5 signal than modern windows. This has practical implications:

1. **Indoor without glasses:** OPN5 receives ~77% of outdoor signal through windows
2. **Outdoor with glasses:** OPN5 receives only ~19% of available signal
3. **The critical intervention is removing glasses, not going outdoors**

This finding explains why some individuals report enhanced alertness and wellbeing when viewing dawn light without glasses, even through windows.

### 4.5 OPN5 Retinal Distribution and Light Direction

Recent characterization of OPN5-expressing retinal ganglion cells (OPN5-RGCs) reveals non-homogeneous distribution across the retina (D'Souza et al., 2022). OPN5-RGCs are concentrated in the **dorsotemporal quadrant** (superior-temporal retina), with lower density in other regions.

This topographic distribution has implications for optimal light direction:

| Retinal Location | Visual Field Source | OPN5-RGC Density |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Dorsotemporal | Lower-nasal field | Highest |
| Dorsonasal | Lower-temporal field | Moderate |
| Ventral | Upper field | Lower |

Light from the **horizon or below eye level** projects to the superior retina where OPN5-RGC density is maximal. This suggests that:

1. **Dawn horizon viewing** may be optimal for OPN5 activation
2. **Overhead light** preferentially activates melanopsin (ipRGCs concentrated in inferior retina)
3. **Natural dawn geometry**—horizon glow below eye level—provides ideal OPN5 stimulation

This contrasts with melanopsin-mediated circadian signaling, which is optimally activated by overhead light projecting to the inferior retina. Dawn naturally provides both signals: horizon glow for OPN5 (alerting) and brightening sky above for melanopsin (circadian).

### 4.6 Lens Material Considerations

Standard eyeglass lens materials differ substantially in their UV/violet transmission characteristics:

**Table 5. UV cutoff by lens material**

| Lens Material | UV Cutoff | 380nm Transmission | OPN5 Compatible |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Crown glass | ~300-320nm | ~80-90% | Yes |
| CR-39 plastic (uncoated) | ~355nm | ~50-70% | Partial |
| CR-39 with UV coating | ~380-400nm | <10% | No |
| Polycarbonate | ~385nm | <5% | No |
| Trivex | ~380nm | <5% | No |
| High-index plastic | ~380-400nm | <5% | No |

Modern plastic lenses (polycarbonate, Trivex, high-index) inherently block 380nm wavelengths without requiring UV coating. This UV protection is marketed as a safety feature but eliminates the OPN5 activation signal.

Only two lens options preserve meaningful 380nm transmission:

1. **Crown glass:** Transmits 380nm freely (cutoff ~300-320nm). Heavier and more fragile but provides superior optical clarity (Abbe 60) and full OPN5 wavelength access.

2. **CR-39 without UV coating:** Partial 380nm transmission. Must explicitly request no UV coating. Lighter than glass with good optical clarity (Abbe 58).

For individuals seeking to preserve OPN5 signaling during dawn/dusk light exposure, these lens options may warrant consideration, particularly for secondary "dawn glasses" used only during low-UV morning hours when UV-A intensity is minimal and OPN5 activation may contribute to natural arousal.

### 4.7 The Myopia Paradox

An apparent paradox emerges: corrective eyeglasses, prescribed to correct refractive errors including myopia, may simultaneously block wavelengths required for myopia prevention. This creates a potential positive feedback loop:

1. Child develops early myopia
2. Corrective eyeglasses are prescribed
3. Eyeglasses block 79% of OPN5-stimulating wavelengths
4. Reduced OPN5 signaling permits further myopia progression
5. Stronger prescription required
6. Cycle continues

This hypothesis is consistent with observations that myopia tends to progress after correction (Chung et al., 2002), though multiple factors likely contribute.

### 4.8 Outdoor Time and Myopia Protection

The protective effect of outdoor time against myopia has been attributed to high illuminance levels (Rose et al., 2008). However, our data suggest an additional mechanism: outdoor time without eyeglasses provides unfiltered access to the OPN5-stimulating violet spectrum.

Notably, even high-illuminance indoor environments would not provide OPN5 stimulation if viewed through eyeglasses, as the blocking occurs regardless of intensity. This may explain why indoor light, even at high levels, does not replicate the protective effects of outdoor exposure (Xiong et al., 2017).

### 4.9 Clinical Implications

If validated by further research, these findings suggest several potential interventions:

1. **Violet-transmitting lens materials:** Development of corrective lenses that block UV-B/UV-C while transmitting UV-A/violet (380-420nm)

2. **Scheduled lens-free outdoor exposure:** Brief periods of outdoor time without eyeglasses to restore OPN5 signaling

3. **Violet light supplementation:** Targeted 380-420nm light exposure for myopia prevention in eyeglass-wearing populations

Any such interventions would require careful consideration of other UV-related risks (photokeratitis, cataract, potential skin effects).

### 4.10 Limitations

This study has several limitations:

1. **Single lens type:** Only one type of corrective lens (polycarbonate with AR coating) was tested. Other lens materials and coatings may differ.

2. **Limited spectral range:** The spectroradiometer range (380-780nm) did not extend into UV-B (<380nm). However, OPN5 peak sensitivity is at 380nm, within our measurement range.

3. **No physiological measurements:** This study characterized spectral transmission only; OPN5 activation was not measured directly.

4. **Single measurement session:** Measurements were obtained at one time and location.

5. **Hypothesis-generating:** The link between eyeglass UV filtering and myopia is proposed as a hypothesis requiring further testing, not established as causative.

---

## 5. Conclusions

Corrective eyeglasses create a UV-circadian dissociation that does not occur in natural unfiltered light, blocking approximately 79% of UV/violet wavelengths while paradoxically enhancing circadian-relevant visible wavelengths. The blocked wavelength range (380-420nm) precisely overlaps the sensitivity peak of OPN5 (neuropsin), recently identified as essential for violet light-mediated myopia prevention.

Given the concurrent rise in myopia prevalence and eyeglass use, particularly in young populations, the potential contribution of chronic OPN5 signal deprivation to myopia progression warrants further investigation. Epidemiological studies correlating eyeglass-wearing patterns with myopia progression, and mechanistic studies of OPN5 signaling under filtered versus unfiltered conditions, are needed to evaluate this hypothesis.
