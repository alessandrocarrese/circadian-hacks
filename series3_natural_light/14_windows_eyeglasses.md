# Windows and Eyeglasses as Spectral Filters
## What's Removed Before Light Reaches Your Eyes

*Part 14 of the Light Science Series*

---


You might think sitting by a window gives you "natural light." Or that your prescription glasses don't affect your circadian system.

Spectral measurements reveal a different story.

Every surface between you and the sun acts as a filter-and some wavelengths are affected far more than others.


## The Double Filter Problem

Most people indoors experience light that has passed through at least two filters:

1. **Window glass** (building envelope)
2. **Eyeglasses** (if worn)

Each filter has its own transmission characteristics. Combined, they can dramatically alter the spectrum reaching your retina.


## What Window Glass Does

Modern double-pane windows (vetrocamera) block light uniformly-but not equally across all wavelengths:

### Transmission Through Window Glass

| Wavelength Band | Transmission | Blocked |
|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| UV (380-400nm) | 28.0% | 72% |
| Violet (400-420nm) | 27.5% | 72.5% |
| S-cone (420-460nm) | 27.7% | 72.3% |
| Melanopsin (460-500nm) | 28.4% | 71.6% |
| Blue (430-470nm) | 27.9% | 72.1% |
| Red (620-700nm) | 24.9% | 75.1% |
| NIR (700-780nm) | 22.2% | **77.8%** |

**Key findings:**
- Window glass blocks **~72% of visible light** uniformly
- But **NIR is blocked more** (77.8%)-problematic for SPR
- Total illuminance drops from 4,799 to 1,322 lux (72.5% reduction)

### The NIR Problem

Window glass preferentially blocks near-infrared:
- NIR (700-780nm): 77.8% blocked
- Blue (430-470nm): 72.1% blocked

This means the blue:NIR ratio shifts unfavorably. You get proportionally more blue relative to the protective NIR wavelengths.


## What Eyeglasses Do

Modern eyeglasses typically include:
- **UV blocking** (standard in most lenses)
- **Anti-reflective (AR) coating** (increases transmission of visible light)
- **Blue light coating** (optional, varies widely)

### Eyeglass Transmission (Without Blue Light Coating)

| Wavelength | Transmission | Effect |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| 380nm (UV) | 7% | **93% blocked** |
| 400nm (violet) | 47% | 53% blocked |
| 420nm (S-cone start) | 110% | Enhanced (AR effect) |
| 445nm (S-cone peak) | 117% | Enhanced |
| 480nm (melanopsin) | 118% | Enhanced |
| 620nm (red) | 123% | Enhanced |
| 700nm (NIR) | 121% | Enhanced |

**The paradox:**
- UV and violet are **dramatically blocked**
- But S-cone, melanopsin, and red are actually **enhanced** by AR coating
- Total illuminance increases 21% (AR reduces reflection losses)

### The Enhancement Effect

Anti-reflective coating reduces the ~8% of light normally reflected at each lens surface. This actually increases transmission above 100% compared to bare eyes (which also reflect some light).


## The Combined Effect: Glasses + Window

When you're indoors with glasses, looking through a window:

### Total Transmission (vs. Open Window, No Glasses)

| Wavelength Band | Transmission | Total Blocked |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| **UV (380-400nm)** | 5.9% | **94.1%** |
| Violet (400-420nm) | 23.9% | 76.1% |
| S-cone (420-460nm) | 32.1% | 67.9% |
| Melanopsin (460-500nm) | 33.6% | 66.4% |
| Blue (430-470nm) | 32.6% | 67.4% |
| Red (620-700nm) | 30.4% | 69.6% |
| NIR (700-780nm) | 26.1% | **73.9%** |

**Final illuminance:** 1,322 lux (33.4% of baseline)


## The UV-Circadian Dissociation

Here's the critical discovery: eyeglasses create a **mismatch** between UV markers and circadian signals.

### Natural Light Pattern (No Glasses)

In natural outdoor light, all wavelengths rise and fall together:
- UV present → S-cone activated → Melanopsin activated
- Everything synchronized
- Brain interprets: "Natural daylight at time X"

### With Eyeglasses: Dissociated Pattern

| Band | Without Glasses | With Glasses | Change |
|------|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| UV (380-400nm) | 100% | 21% | **-79%** |
| Violet (400-420nm) | 100% | 87% | -13% |
| S-cone (420-460nm) | 100% | 116% | **+16%** |
| Melanopsin (460-500nm) | 100% | 118% | **+18%** |
| Red/NIR (620-780nm) | 100% | 120% | **+20%** |

**The dissociation ratio:**
- Without glasses: UV and circadian signals synchronized (ratio 1.0)
- With glasses: Circadian signals 5.5× stronger relative to UV

### What Your Brain Receives

**Without glasses (coherent):**
- UV present: ✓
- S-cone activation: ✓  
- Melanopsin activation: ✓
- Interpretation: "Natural daylight, clear time signal"

**With glasses (dissociated):**
- UV present: ✗ (only 21%)
- S-cone activation: ✓✓ (enhanced)
- Melanopsin activation: ✓✓ (enhanced)
- Interpretation: "Strong activation... but no UV? What time is it?"


## Why UV Markers Might Matter

### The UV Timing Hypothesis

UV radiation from the sun follows predictable daily patterns:
- **Morning:** UV rising
- **Midday:** UV peak
- **Afternoon:** UV declining  
- **Sunset:** UV minimal
- **Evening:** UV absent

Your brain may use UV as a **temporal context marker**:
- High UV + high S-cone = "Morning/midday"
- Low UV + moderate S-cone = "Late afternoon"
- No UV + low S-cone = "Evening"

When glasses block UV but enhance circadian wavelengths, the signal becomes ambiguous:
- "Strong circadian activation says morning..."
- "But no UV says indoor/evening..."
- Result: Temporal uncertainty


## CCT Shift Patterns

The filters affect color temperature perception:

| Condition | CCT | Change |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| No filter (open window, no glasses) | 5675K | Baseline |
| + Eyeglasses only | 5473K | -202K (warmer) |
| + Window glass (double filter) | 5739K | +64K (cooler) |

**The counterintuitive result:**
- Glasses alone warm the spectrum (block violet)
- Window glass cools it back (blocks more red/NIR than blue)
- Combined effect is slight cooling


## SPR Impact

### Spectral Protection Ratio Changes

| Condition | SPR | Change |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| Open window, no glasses | 3.56 | Baseline |
| + Eyeglasses | 3.64 | +2.4% (better) |
| + Eyeglasses + Window | 3.09 | **-13.1% (worse)** |

**The window problem:**
- Window glass blocks more NIR (77.8%) than blue (72.1%)
- This shifts the protective ratio unfavorably
- SPR drops 13% below baseline


## Practical Implications

### 1. Window Light ≠ Outdoor Light
Sitting by a window provides only 33% of the light intensity and an altered spectrum. For morning light exposure, step outside when possible.

### 2. Glasses Create UV Dissociation
If you wear glasses, your brain receives enhanced circadian signals but dramatically reduced UV markers. The long-term implications are unknown but potentially significant.

### 3. Double Filtering Compounds Effects
Each filter between you and the sun removes information. Two filters can block 94% of UV and significantly alter the overall spectrum.

### 4. NIR Loss Is Underappreciated
Both windows and glasses preferentially block NIR relative to blue light, worsening the protective ratio that natural light provides.

### 5. Consider Contact Lenses for Morning Light
If circadian health is a priority, contact lenses (which don't block UV reaching the eye from oblique angles) may provide a more natural spectral signal during morning light exposure.


## Key Takeaways

1. **Window glass blocks ~72% of all visible light** and 78% of NIR
2. **Eyeglasses block 93% of UV** while enhancing circadian wavelengths
3. **Combined blocking reaches 94% for UV** and 74% for NIR
4. **UV-circadian dissociation** of 5.5× may create temporal ambiguity
5. **SPR worsens by 13%** when viewing through windows

## Technical Appendix

### Measurement Protocol
- Baseline: Open window, no eyeglasses
- Eyeglasses: Standard prescription with AR coating, UV block
- Window: Modern double-pane glass (vetrocamera)
- Spectral range: 380-780nm at 1nm resolution

### UV-Circadian Ratio
Calculated as: (UV 380-400nm) / (S-cone 420-460nm)
- Natural: 0.312
- With glasses: 0.056 (5.5× dissociation)
- With glasses + window: 0.057 (unchanged-dissociation is from glasses)

### AR Coating Effect
Anti-reflective coatings reduce surface reflection from ~4% per surface to <0.5%, effectively increasing transmission above baseline for a bare substrate.
