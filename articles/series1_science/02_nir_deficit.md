# The NIR Deficit: What Modern Lighting Is Missing

*Your LED bulbs are missing 70-80% of what sunlight provides*

---


In the previous article, we introduced the Spectral Protection Ratio (SPR)-the balance between protective red/NIR wavelengths and potentially harmful blue wavelengths in light sources. But SPR only tells part of the story.

Even with a decent SPR, most artificial light sources have a critical deficiency: **they contain almost no near-infrared (NIR) light**.

This isn't a minor omission. It's a **70-80% deficit** compared to natural daylight-and it may explain why even "good" artificial lighting feels fundamentally different from being outdoors.


## What Is Near-Infrared Light?

Near-infrared (NIR) refers to wavelengths between 700-1000nm-just beyond the red visible spectrum. You can't see NIR, but your body can sense and use it.

Natural sunlight is approximately:
- **44% visible light** (380-700nm)
- **52% infrared** (700-2500nm, mostly NIR)
- **4% ultraviolet** (below 380nm)

The NIR portion isn't just "heat"-it carries specific biological signals that your cells have evolved to expect.


## NIR Content Across Light Sources

Here's what spectral analysis reveals about NIR content (measured as percentage of total spectral power in the 380-780nm range):

| Light Source | NIR Content | vs Natural Shade |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| Natural shade (baseline) | 17.0% | - |
| Tree-filtered sunlight | 30.5% | +79% |
| Morning direct sun | 14.2% | -16% |
| **Dimmed incandescent** | **54.0%** | **+218%** |
| Best warm LED tested | 5.3% | **-69%** |
| Typical warm LED | 4.1% | **-76%** |
| Cool white LED | 2.8% | **-84%** |
| Computer monitor | <0.1% | **-99%** |

**The pattern is striking**: LEDs contain 70-85% less NIR than natural daylight. Computer monitors contain essentially zero.

Incandescent bulbs, by contrast, contain *more* NIR than natural light-they're essentially small thermal radiators that happen to emit visible light as a byproduct.


## Why NIR Matters: Cytochrome C Oxidase

NIR isn't just filler wavelengths. It drives a specific biological mechanism: **photobiomodulation via cytochrome c oxidase (CCO)**.

CCO is the terminal enzyme in your mitochondrial electron transport chain-the final step in cellular respiration that produces ATP (cellular energy). CCO contains copper centers that absorb light in specific bands:

- **620-680nm** (red): Primary absorption peak
- **760-830nm** (NIR): Secondary absorption peak
- **Peak at 670nm**: Highest photobiological activity

**Scientific validation**: "CCO is the major intracellular acceptor of photons in red to near-infrared wavelengths... promotes increased ATP synthesis by mitochondria" ([PMC5844808](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5844808/)).

When these wavelengths reach CCO, they:
1. **Dissociate nitric oxide (NO)** from the enzyme's binding sites
2. **Increase electron transport** efficiency
3. **Boost ATP production** by 5-15%
4. **Reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS)** generation
5. **Upregulate antioxidant gene expression**

This is the basis of "red light therapy" or "photobiomodulation"-now a well-established field with thousands of peer-reviewed studies.


## The Natural Light Advantage

Under natural daylight, your cells receive continuous low-level NIR exposure. This provides:

### Baseline Mitochondrial Support
NIR wavelengths penetrate tissue-including through closed eyelids-and reach mitochondria throughout the body. Natural outdoor exposure delivers constant photobiomodulation without any specialized equipment.

### Blue Light Preconditioning
Studies show that 670nm red light exposure **before** blue light exposure significantly reduces subsequent photochemical damage. Natural light provides both simultaneously-the NIR "preconditions" tissues against the blue.

### Metabolic Regulation
NIR exposure influences glucose metabolism:
- Red/NIR light reduces blood glucose by 27.7% at 2 hours post-meal
- It reduces peak glucose spikes by 7.5%
- It improves cellular glucose uptake independent of insulin

When you're outdoors, you get this metabolic support automatically. Indoors under LEDs, you don't.


## The LED Problem: Physics vs Biology

Why don't LEDs contain NIR? It's not an oversight-it's physics.

### How LEDs Work
LEDs produce light through electroluminescence: electrons crossing a semiconductor junction release photons at specific wavelengths determined by the material's band gap.

**Blue LED chips** (gallium nitride) emit at 450nm
**Phosphor coating** absorbs blue and re-emits across the visible spectrum

This process is optimized for:
- Electrical efficiency (lumens per watt)
- Color appearance (CRI, CCT)
- Manufacturing cost

It is **not** optimized for biological compatibility.

### Why NIR Is "Wasted"
From an engineering standpoint, NIR is pure waste:
- It doesn't contribute to visible illumination (lumens)
- It increases heat output
- It reduces electrical efficiency ratings

Every watt of NIR an LED produces is a watt that doesn't become "useful" visible light. So engineers eliminate it.

### Incandescent: Inefficient for Lighting, Excellent for Biology
Incandescent bulbs work differently. A tungsten filament heated to ~2700K radiates across the blackbody spectrum-including substantial NIR.

This makes incandescents "inefficient" by lighting standards (only ~5% of energy becomes visible light). But it makes them **excellent** by biological standards-they produce the full spectrum our cells expect.

The push to eliminate incandescents for energy efficiency has inadvertently created a population-wide NIR deficit.


## Measuring the Deficit

Let's quantify what we're missing.

**Natural shade exposure (1 hour outdoors):**
- NIR content: 17% of spectral power
- Relative NIR dose: 100% (baseline)

**LED office lighting (1 hour indoors):**
- NIR content: 3-5% of spectral power
- Relative NIR dose: 18-29% of natural

**Computer work (1 hour):**
- NIR content: <0.1% of spectral power
- Relative NIR dose: <1% of natural

A typical office worker spending 8 hours under LEDs and screens receives **less than 5% of the NIR exposure** their biology expects.


## The Incandescent Comparison

Spectral analysis of a dimmed 40W incandescent bulb reveals extraordinary characteristics:

| Metric | Incandescent | Cold LED | Ratio |
|--------|--------------|----------|-------|
| SPR | 112.74 | 0.64 | **176×** |
| NIR content | 54% | 3% | **18×** |
| Blue content | 0.75% | 28.6% | **0.03×** |
| CCT | 1983K | 6500K | - |

The dimmed incandescent produces 18× more NIR and 38× less blue than the cold LED. Its SPR is 176× higher.

This doesn't mean you should illuminate your workspace with incandescents at full brightness (that would be impractical and energy-intensive). But for **evening use**, when circadian considerations favor warm light anyway, incandescent or halogen sources provide biological benefits that LEDs cannot match.


## Window Glass Makes It Worse

Even if you sit near a window, you may not be getting the NIR you expect.

Modern double-pane windows with Low-E coatings are designed to block infrared (to reduce cooling costs). Spectral measurements show:

| Window Type | NIR Transmission | NIR Deficit |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| Vintage single-pane | 81.6% | 18.4% |
| Modern double-pane | 38.7% | 61.3% |

Modern windows block **61% of NIR** while passing 47% of visible light. They selectively remove the protective wavelengths while allowing the potentially harmful ones through.

The result: sitting by a modern window provides **2.1× less NIR** than the same position with vintage glass-even at identical visible light levels.


## Solutions for NIR Deficit

### 1. Increase Outdoor Time
The simplest solution: spend more time outside. Even shade contains 17% NIR. Even overcast days provide NIR (clouds don't block it as effectively as visible light).

**Target**: 30-60 minutes of outdoor exposure daily, preferably morning.

### 2. Open Windows When Possible
If you have vintage/single-pane windows or can open them, do so. This eliminates the Low-E NIR blocking.

### 3. Use Incandescent/Halogen for Evening
Replace evening LEDs with incandescent or halogen sources. The "inefficiency" is actually delivering NIR your body needs. A 40W incandescent at night provides better biological value than a "more efficient" LED.

### 4. Consider NIR Supplementation
Dedicated red/NIR light panels (wavelengths 630-850nm) can supplement the deficit. These are sold for "red light therapy" but also work as ambient NIR sources.

For targeted exposure:
- **670nm red**: Peak CCO activation
- **810nm NIR**: Deeper tissue penetration

For ambient supplementation:
- Low-power panels providing background NIR
- Position to illuminate face/eyes and exposed skin

### 5. Monitor Your Lighting Choices
When possible, choose light sources with measurable NIR content. High-R9 warm LEDs contain more red/NIR than standard LEDs, though still far less than incandescent.


## The Dual Criteria for Safe Lighting

Based on this analysis, truly safe indoor lighting requires meeting two criteria:

1. **SPR ≥ 1.7** (spectral balance)
2. **NIR ≥ 15%** (absolute content)

Currently, **no commercial LED meets both criteria**.

- Best warm LEDs: SPR 6.21, NIR 5.3% ❌
- Incandescent: SPR 112.74, NIR 54% ✓✓

This suggests that optimal indoor lighting may require:
- LED for daytime task lighting (good CRI, high R9)
- **Plus** incandescent/halogen for ambient warmth and NIR
- **Or** dedicated NIR supplementation panels


## The Bottom Line

Modern lighting is optimized for energy efficiency and visual appearance-not biological compatibility. The drive to eliminate "inefficient" incandescents has created a population-wide NIR deficit.

Your LED bulbs deliver 70-80% less NIR than natural daylight. Your computer monitor delivers essentially zero. Modern windows block 61% of what little NIR reaches indoors.

This deficit matters because NIR drives specific biological processes:
- Mitochondrial ATP production
- Cellular protection against blue light damage
- Glucose metabolism regulation
- Antioxidant defense upregulation

The solution isn't necessarily to abandon LEDs-they're practical for daytime use. But it is to **recognize what's missing** and take steps to restore it:
- More outdoor time
- Incandescent for evening
- NIR supplementation when needed
- Awareness of window glass effects

Your cells are waiting for wavelengths that never arrive. Now you know why-and what to do about it.
