# What Your Eyes Actually See: Spectral Bands Explained

*A visual guide to UV, violet, blue, cyan, and beyond*

---


Throughout this series, we've referenced specific wavelength ranges-"S-cone band," "melanopic peak," "blue hazard region." But unless you have a background in photobiology, these numbers might feel abstract.

This article provides a complete reference guide to the spectral bands that matter for circadian health, eye safety, and metabolic function. Consider it a glossary you can return to whenever wavelength numbers appear in lighting discussions.


## The Visible Spectrum: 380-780nm

Human vision spans wavelengths from approximately **380nm (violet)** to **780nm (deep red)**. But not all wavelengths within this range have equal biological significance.

Here's how the spectrum breaks down:

| Band | Wavelength | Color | Key Function |
|------|------------|-------|--------------|
| UV-B | 280-315nm | (invisible) | Vitamin D synthesis (skin only) |
| UV-A | 315-400nm | (invisible) | Photoaging, tanning, some DNA damage |
| Violet | 380-420nm | Violet | Oxidative stress, lens absorption |
| S-cone peak | 420-460nm | Blue-violet | S-cone activation, circadian (early) |
| Blue hazard | 430-470nm | Blue | Photochemical damage peak |
| Melanopsin peak | 460-500nm | Cyan-blue | Circadian signaling (sustained) |
| Cyan | 480-500nm | Cyan | Peak melanopsin sensitivity |
| Green | 500-570nm | Green | L/M cone vision |
| Yellow | 570-590nm | Yellow | Transition zone |
| Orange | 590-620nm | Orange | Transition zone |
| Red | 620-700nm | Red | CCO activation, protection |
| NIR | 700-1000nm | (invisible) | Deep CCO activation, penetration |

Let's examine each band's significance.


## UV-A (315-400nm): The Edge of Visibility

**What it does:**
- Causes tanning response in skin
- Contributes to photoaging (collagen breakdown)
- Absorbed by eye's crystalline lens (protective blocking)
- Can cause DNA damage with chronic exposure

**Note:** Vitamin D synthesis requires **UV-B (280-315nm)**, not UV-A. UV-B is blocked by window glass and most materials.

**Key insight:**
UV-A is almost completely blocked by:
- Window glass (95%+ blocked)
- Eyeglasses with AR coating (79% blocked)
- The eye's own lens (increases with age)

**In artificial light:**
Most LEDs contain negligible UV-A. This isn't necessarily good-UV presence may serve as a "time marker" for natural outdoor exposure. Its absence indoors may contribute to circadian ambiguity.


## Violet (380-420nm): The High-Energy Zone

**What it does:**
- High photon energy (3.0-3.3 eV)-only 1-5% less than UV-A
- Absorbed by lipofuscin/A2E in retinal pigment epithelium
- Can trigger oxidative stress pathways

**Key insight:**
Violet is only 5-20nm above UV-A. It carries nearly UV-level photon energy and triggers oxidative pathways:
- Lipofuscin photooxidation (retinal)
- Melanogenesis activation (skin)
- ROS generation in exposed tissues

**Note on DNA damage:** True DNA damage (CPD formation, mutations) is primarily caused by **UV-B (280-315nm)**. Violet light's main hazards are oxidative, not directly mutagenic.

**In artificial light:**
- Standard blue-pump LEDs: Low violet (0.5-2%)
- "Violet-pump" premium LEDs: Higher violet (3-5%)

Premium high-CRI LEDs using violet pumps may increase oxidative stress while improving color rendering. This trade-off is rarely discussed in marketing.


## S-Cone Peak (420-460nm): Early Circadian Activation

**What it does:**
- Activates S-cones (short-wavelength cones)
- Dominates circadian signaling in first 1-2 hours of exposure
- Peak at ~440nm

**Key insight:**
S-cones drive the **initial** circadian response to light. During the first 1.6 hours of exposure, S-cones contribute 51% of circadian input.

**In natural light:**
- Morning sky scatter: 16-17% in this band
- Direct sun: 8-10% in this band
- Evening: 2-5% in this band

**In artificial light:**
- Cold LEDs: 18-22% (potentially excessive)
- Warm LEDs: 4-6% (appropriate for evening)
- Target: 15-20% for morning, 8-12% for sustained daytime


## Blue Hazard (430-470nm): The Risk Peak

**What it does:**
- Peak wavelengths for photochemical retinal damage
- Targets lipofuscin and A2E in retinal pigment epithelium
- Generates reactive oxygen species (ROS)
- Degrades riboflavin and folate

**Key insight:**
This is where blue light hazard (BLH) weighting is highest. The IEC 62471 standard peaks at 435-445nm.

However, BLH risk depends on **absolute irradiance**, not just percentage. Natural sunlight contains blue hazard wavelengths but also high SPR-the protective wavelengths compensate.

**In artificial light:**
- LED blue peaks often at 450-455nm (center of hazard zone)
- Monitors: 445nm peak, 28-30% of total power
- Concern is **ratio to protective wavelengths**, not absolute presence


## Melanopsin Peak (460-500nm): Sustained Circadian

**What it does:**
- Activates melanopsin in ipRGCs
- Dominates circadian signaling after 3+ hours exposure
- Peak sensitivity at 480-485nm (cyan)

**Key insight:**
Melanopsin takes over from S-cones as exposure duration increases. By 6+ hours, melanopsin accounts for 92% of circadian input.

The lambda-max shifts from 441nm (S-cone) to 485nm (melanopsin) over extended exposure. Light sources optimized for "blue light" at 450nm may actually be less effective for sustained circadian signaling than cyan-peaked sources.

**In artificial light:**
- Most LEDs have valley (not peak) at 480nm
- Natural light has smooth curve through this region
- Some "circadian" LEDs now target 480nm specifically


## Cyan (480-500nm): Peak Melanopsin Sensitivity

**What it does:**
- Exact peak of melanopsin sensitivity
- Maximum circadian input per photon
- Drives sustained alerting response

**Key insight:**
If you want to maximize circadian stimulus with minimum photons, cyan is more effective than blue. A cyan-peaked source at 485nm delivers stronger circadian signal than a blue-peaked source at 450nm at equal intensity.

**In natural light:**
- 4-6% of total power
- Relatively stable throughout day
- Not reduced at sunset (unlike violet/blue)

**In artificial light:**
- Often a "valley" between blue peak (450nm) and phosphor curve
- Some advanced LEDs now include cyan phosphors to fill this gap


## Green (500-570nm): Visual Dominance

**What it does:**
- Peak photopic sensitivity (L and M cones)
- Drives conscious visual perception
- Minimal direct circadian effect

**Key insight:**
Green light is what your conscious vision responds to most strongly. The photopic luminosity function V(λ) peaks at 555nm.

This means "brightness" as perceived by your eyes is dominated by green-but circadian effects are dominated by blue/cyan. A light can appear bright while being circadianly weak, or vice versa.

**In artificial light:**
- Phosphor emission fills this range well
- 45-55% of total power typical
- Contributes to visual comfort, not circadian input


## Yellow/Orange (570-620nm): The Transition

**What it does:**
- Transition between peak visibility and red
- Minimal direct biological effect
- Contributes to warm color appearance

**Key insight:**
This region is relatively neutral-neither harmful nor particularly protective. It fills out the color rendering of a light source without strong circadian or metabolic effects.

**In artificial light:**
- 10-20% of total power typical
- Contributes to CRI (color rendering)
- Aesthetically "warm" appearance


## Red (620-700nm): The Protective Band

**What it does:**
- Activates cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) in mitochondria
- Increases ATP production
- Provides preconditioning against blue light damage
- Supports glucose metabolism

**Key insight:**
Red light is the primary protective wavelength in visible spectrum. It drives photobiomodulation and counteracts blue light oxidative stress.

Peak CCO activation is at **670nm**-look for light sources with strong 670nm output for maximum protection.

**In natural light:**
- 8-12% of total power
- Increases toward sunset (up to 20-25%)
- Always present alongside blue

**In artificial light:**
- Warm LEDs: 8-15%
- Cold LEDs: 3-6% (deficient)
- Incandescent: 15-25%
- Target: >8% for adequate protection


## Near-Infrared (700-1000nm): Deep Protection

**What it does:**
- Penetrates tissue more deeply than red
- Activates CCO via secondary absorption peak
- Provides systemic photobiomodulation
- Peak biological activity at 810nm

**Key insight:**
NIR is invisible but biologically active. Natural daylight contains ~17% NIR (as fraction of 380-780nm range extrapolated). LEDs contain 3-7%. This 70-80% deficit may have significant health implications.

**In artificial light:**
- LEDs: 2-7% (severely deficient)
- Incandescent: 30-55% (abundant)
- NIR panels: Targeted supplementation option


## Putting It Together: A Complete Spectral Assessment

When evaluating a light source for health impact, consider:

### Potentially Harmful Bands
- **Violet (380-420nm)**: Minimize (<2% ideal)
- **Blue hazard (430-470nm)**: Balance with red/NIR (SPR >1.7)

### Circadian Active Bands
- **S-cone (420-460nm)**: 15-20% morning, 8-12% daytime, <5% evening
- **Cyan (480-500nm)**: 4-6% for sustained circadian support

### Protective Bands
- **Red (620-700nm)**: >8% for adequate protection
- **NIR (700-780nm+)**: >10% ideally, >15% optimal

### Quality Indicators
- **High SPR (>1.7)**: Adequate protective balance
- **High R9 (>90)**: Strong red content
- **Low blue:red ratio (<1.5:1)**: Metabolic safety


## Reference Table: Natural Light Composition

| Condition | UV% | Violet% | S-cone% | Blue% | Cyan% | Green% | Red% | NIR% |
|-----------|-----|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|------|------|
| Morning direct sun | 0 | 4.8 | 8.0 | 5.2 | 4.2 | 45 | 10 | 14 |
| Morning sky only | 0 | 16.2 | 16.7 | 8.1 | 5.5 | 35 | 6 | 8 |
| Afternoon | 0 | 8.7 | 12.3 | 7.2 | 5.4 | 43 | 8 | 11 |
| Before sunset | 0 | 13.1 | 16.2 | 8.6 | 6.0 | 40 | 7 | 9 |
| Sunset | 0 | 11.4 | 14.3 | 7.8 | 5.5 | 42 | 9 | 10 |

Notice how S-cone content varies from 8% (direct sun) to 17% (sky scatter)-but is never sustained above 17% for extended periods.

| Incandescent | 0.1 | 0.8 | 0.8 | 15.2 | 54.0 | 112 |
| Monitor | 2.1 | 24.3 | 28.6 | 2.1 | <0.1 | 0.64 |

Notice the stark contrast between cold LEDs (21% S-cone, 3% NIR) and incandescent (0.8% S-cone, 54% NIR).
