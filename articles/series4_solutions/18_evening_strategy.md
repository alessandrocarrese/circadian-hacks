# The Evening Light Strategy
## Preparing Your Brain for Sleep

*Part 18 of the Light Science Series*

---


Most sleep advice focuses on the hour before bed. But the real window for evening light management starts much earlier-and the science explains why.

Your brain doesn't have an instant off-switch. The transition from day to night is a gradual process that requires the right light signals at the right times.


## The Problem: Melanopsin at Night

By evening, after hours of light exposure, your circadian system has shifted to melanopsin dominance:

| Time into Light Exposure | Melanopsin Contribution |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| 0-1.6 hours | 2% |
| 1.6-3.25 hours | 51% |
| 3.25-4.9 hours | 79% |
| 4.9+ hours | **92%** |

**By evening, melanopsin contributes 92% of circadian signaling.**

And here's the critical point: **Melanopsin doesn't adapt.**

This means your circadian system is maximally sensitive to light exactly when you're typically still under artificial lighting.


## The Natural Template

Here's what your body expects at sunset:

| Time Relative to Sunset | MEDI (lux) | Effect |
|------------------------|------------|--------|
| Afternoon | 1,038 | Strong suppression |
| Before Sunset | 36 | Weakening |
| Exact Sunset | 16 | Minimal suppression |
| 30 min after | 7 | **Melatonin can rise** |
| 60 min after | 1 | Safe for sleep prep |

**The key threshold:** MEDI below 10 lux allows melatonin onset.

Most indoor lighting keeps you well above this threshold:
- Typical living room: 50-150 MEDI
- Bright kitchen: 100-200 MEDI
- Office lighting: 150-300 MEDI


## The Two-Phase Evening

### Phase 1: Wind-Down (Sunset to DLMO-2 hours)

**Timing:** From local sunset to ~2 hours before your target bedtime

**Goal:** Reduce MEDI to 30-50 lux range

**Strategy:**
- Dim all overhead lighting to 25-50%
- Switch cold/neutral LEDs to warm (2700K or warmer)
- Close blinds/curtains at sunset
- Move activities to warmly-lit areas

**Why this works:** Gentle reduction mimics natural decline, signals "day is ending"

### Phase 2: Sleep Prep (DLMO-2 hours to bed)

**Timing:** Final 2 hours before sleep

**Goal:** Reduce MEDI to <10 lux

**Strategy:**
- Switch to extra warm LEDs (2000-2200K) or amber/red
- Use minimal lighting for navigation
- Eliminate screens or use aggressive blue filtering
- Consider candlelight or narrow-band red LEDs

**Why this works:** Gets below melatonin suppression threshold


## The Screen Problem

### Why Screens Are Especially Bad at Night

Screens deliver:
- Direct light to eyes (no ambient diffusion)
- Close viewing distance (high retinal irradiance)
- Gaze-locked exposure (continuous, same retinal area)
- Blue-rich spectra (most displays peak at 450nm)

### Screen MEDI at Typical Distance

| Device | Distance | MEDI |
|--------|----------|------|
| Smartphone | 30cm | 30-80 lux |
| Tablet | 40cm | 40-100 lux |
| Laptop | 50cm | 25-60 lux |
| TV | 2m | 5-15 lux |
| Monitor | 60cm | 30-80 lux |

**All except TV exceed the 10 lux threshold at typical use.**

### Mitigation Strategies

**Software (partial solution):**
- Night mode / Night Shift (shifts to orange)
- f.lux or similar with aggressive settings
- Reduces blue but doesn't eliminate melanopic content

**Hardware (better solution):**
- Blue-blocking screen filters (physical overlays)
- Blue-blocking glasses (filter all sources)
- E-ink devices for reading (no backlight)

**Best solution:**
- No screens 2 hours before bed
- If necessary, maximum dimming + filtering + distance


## Specific Strategies

### Living Room

**Before sunset:**
- Normal lighting acceptable
- Mix of ceiling and ambient

**After sunset (Wind-Down):**
- Dim ceiling lights to 25%
- Switch to table lamps (lower position = reduced melanopsin)
- Use warm bulbs only (2700K or lower)

**Pre-sleep (2 hours before bed):**
- Turn off ceiling lights entirely
- Single dim lamp or candles
- Extra warm LEDs (2000-2200K)

### Kitchen

**Challenge:** Bright task lighting often needed

**Strategy:**
- Use under-cabinet lighting only (avoids overhead melanopsin pathway)
- Install dimmable warm LEDs
- Minimize evening kitchen time if possible
- Consider narrow-band amber task light

### Bedroom

**Rule:** Bedroom should transition to complete darkness

**Pre-sleep:**
- Extra warm bedside lamps only
- No overhead lighting
- All screens out of room or face-down

**During sleep:**
- Complete darkness (blackout recommended)
- If nightlight needed: narrow-band red (660nm), extremely dim
- No white light sources

### Bathroom

**Challenge:** Often the brightest room, used right before bed

**Strategy:**
- Install dimmer switches (essential)
- Consider separate night-mode lighting (amber LEDs)
- Use dim red nightlight for nighttime bathroom visits
- Avoid bright overhead until morning


## The Blue-Blocker Question

### Do Blue-Blocking Glasses Work?

**Yes, with caveats:**
- Reduce melanopic content by 30-90% depending on filter
- Orange-tinted block more than yellow-tinted
- Red-tinted block most (but poor visibility)
- Don't eliminate all melanopic light-they reduce it

### When to Use Them

| Timing | Lens Type | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| After sunset | Light amber | Reduce MEDI gently |
| 2 hours before bed | Orange/deep amber | Strong reduction |
| Night bathroom | Red | Maximum protection |

### Limitations

- Don't block light from above forehead (non-glasses light)
- Inconsistent quality between brands
- May not work if ambient lighting is too bright
- Not a replacement for dimming actual light sources


## The Evening Timeline

**Example for 10:30pm bedtime:**

```
6:00pm - Sunset
├─ Begin dimming
├─ Switch to warm bulbs
├─ Close blinds
│
7:00pm - Wind-Down continues
├─ 50% brightness or less
├─ Table lamps over ceiling lights
├─ Optional: amber glasses for screens
│
8:30pm - Pre-Sleep Phase (2 hours before bed)
├─ Extra warm lighting only
├─ <10 MEDI target
├─ Screens off or heavy filtering
├─ Optional: orange/red glasses
│
9:30pm - Final hour
├─ Minimal lighting
├─ Bedroom prep
├─ Complete darkness goal
│
10:30pm - Sleep
├─ Full darkness
├─ No light sources in room
```


## What Happens If You Don't Do This

### Immediate Effects
- Melatonin onset delayed 30-90 minutes
- Difficulty falling asleep
- Lighter, less restorative early sleep

### Cumulative Effects
- Chronic sleep phase delay
- Gradual circadian drift
- Daytime fatigue (compensatory)
- Potential metabolic disruption

### The Weekend Trap

Many people maintain bright evening light weekdays, then experience:
- Natural sleep timing on weekends (no morning alarm)
- "Social jet lag" when returning to work schedule
- Perpetual cycle of phase delay and forced advancement


## Key Takeaways

1. **Start at sunset:** Don't wait until bedtime to manage light
2. **Melanopsin dominates by evening:** 92% contribution, no adaptation
3. **Target <10 MEDI** for final 2 hours before bed
4. **Screens are problematic:** Direct, gaze-locked, blue-rich light
5. **Position matters:** Lower light sources reduce melanopsin activation
6. **Blue-blockers help but aren't sufficient** alone

## Technical Appendix

### MEDI Calculation

Melanopic EDI (Equivalent Daylight Illuminance) is calculated per CIE S 026:2018:
- Weights spectral power by melanopsin sensitivity (peak 490nm)
- Expresses result in lux-equivalent units
- Allows comparison across different light sources

### Thresholds (Research Consensus)

| MEDI | Effect |
|------|--------|
| >250 lux | Strong melatonin suppression |
| 100-250 lux | Moderate suppression |
| 30-100 lux | Mild suppression |
| 10-30 lux | Phase shift threshold |
| <10 lux | Safe for melatonin onset |

### Melanopsin Temporal Dynamics

Unlike cone photoreceptors, melanopsin:
- Does not show rapid adaptation
- Maintains sensitivity over hours
- Integrates light exposure over time
- Makes evening sensitivity predictably high
